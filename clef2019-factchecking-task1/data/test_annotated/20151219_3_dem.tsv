1	RADDATZ	Good evening to you all.	0
2	RADDATZ	The rules for tonight are very basic and have been agreed to by all three campaigns in advance.	0
3	RADDATZ	Candidates can take up to a minute-and-a-half to respond directly to a question.	0
4	RADDATZ	For a rebuttal, for a follow-up, 45 seconds will be allowed.	0
5	RADDATZ	There are green, yellow, and red lights that each candidate will see to signal when time is running out and when they're supposed to be finished with their answers.	0
6	MUIR	We will be tackling many critical issues right here tonight, and we begin with opening statements, in alphabetical order, and Secretary Clinton.	0
7	CLINTON	Well, thank you.	0
8	CLINTON	And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.	0
9	CLINTON	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.	0
10	CLINTON	That's the job.	0
11	CLINTON	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.	0
12	CLINTON	I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.	0
13	CLINTON	From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.	0
14	CLINTON	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.	0
15	CLINTON	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.	0
16	CLINTON	And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.	0
17	CLINTON	So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.	0
18	CLINTON	Thank you.	0
19	RADDATZ	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
20	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
21	RADDATZ	Governor O'Malley?	0
22	O'MALLEY	Martha, thank you.	0
23	O'MALLEY	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.	0
24	O'MALLEY	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.	0
25	O'MALLEY	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.	0
26	O'MALLEY	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.	0
27	O'MALLEY	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.	0
28	O'MALLEY	I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.	0
29	O'MALLEY	What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger.	0
30	O'MALLEY	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.	0
31	O'MALLEY	What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.	0
32	O'MALLEY	We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.	0
33	O'MALLEY	But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.	0
34	O'MALLEY	We are a better country than this.	0
35	O'MALLEY	Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.	0
36	O'MALLEY	And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together.	0
37	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
38	MUIR	Senator Sanders.	0
39	SANDERS	Good evening.	0
40	SANDERS	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.	0
41	SANDERS	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.	0
42	SANDERS	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.	0
43	SANDERS	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.	0
44	SANDERS	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.	0
45	SANDERS	"I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground."	0
46	SANDERS	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.	0
47	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
48	MUIR	Senator Sanders thank you and thank you all.	0
49	MUIR	We do have a lot of important issues to get here tonight and we want to address the controversy of the last 24 hours right off the top because we heard some of the most heated rhetoric of the campaign so far between two of the campaigns on this stage tonight.	0
50	MUIR	"Senator Sanders, you fired a campaign staffer you have sued the Democratic National Committee; all of this after your campaign acknowledge that some of your staffers quote, ""irresponsibly accessed data from another campaign."""	0
51	MUIR	"The Clinton campaign called this a very egregious breech of data of ethics and said, quote, ""our data was stolen."""	0
52	MUIR	Did they overstate this or were your staffers essentially stealing part of the Clinton playbook?	0
53	SANDERS	David, let me give you a little bit of background here.	0
54	SANDERS	The DNC has hired vendors.	0
55	SANDERS	On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago.	0
56	SANDERS	Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign.	0
57	SANDERS	"And when our staffers said, ""whoa, what's going here?"""	0
58	SANDERS	They went to the DNC quietly.	0
59	SANDERS	"They went to the vendor and said, ""hey, something is wrong,"" and that was quietly dealt with."	0
60	SANDERS	None of that information was looked at.	0
61	SANDERS	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.	0
62	SANDERS	A few days ago a similar incident happened.	0
63	SANDERS	There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign.	0
64	SANDERS	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.	0
65	SANDERS	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.	0
66	SANDERS	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.	0
67	SANDERS	Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.	0
68	SANDERS	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.	0
69	SANDERS	That is an egregious act.	0
70	SANDERS	I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.	0
71	SANDERS	Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.	0
72	SANDERS	Don't know that.	0
73	SANDERS	But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.	0
74	SANDERS	Last point.	0
75	SANDERS	When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it.	0
76	SANDERS	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.	0
77	MUIR	But Senator, you do mention the DNC -- the vender.	0
78	MUIR	But you said of your staff that they did the wrong thing.	0
79	SANDERS	Absolutely.	0
80	SANDERS	Bernie Sanders apologizes to Hillary Clinton	0
81	SANDERS	At ABC's Democratic presidential debate, candidate Bernie Sanders apologizes to rival Hillary Clinton for a scandal involving key voter data.	0
82	MUIR	So, does Secretary Clinton deserve an apology tonight?	0
83	SANDERS	Yes, I apologize.	0
84	MUIR	Secretary Clinton...	0
85	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
86	SANDERS	Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters.	0
87	SANDERS	This is not the type of campaign that we run.	0
88	SANDERS	And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.	0
89	MUIR	Secretary Clinton, he has apologized.	0
90	MUIR	How do your react?	0
91	CLINTON	I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.	0
92	CLINTON	It really is important that we go forward on this.	0
93	CLINTON	I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.	0
94	CLINTON	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.	0
95	CLINTON	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.	0
96	CLINTON	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.	0
97	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
98	CLINTON	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.	0
99	O'MALLEY	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.	0
100	O'MALLEY	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.	0
101	O'MALLEY	You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?	0
102	O'MALLEY	Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.	0
103	O'MALLEY	Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.	0
104	O'MALLEY	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.	0
105	O'MALLEY	We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table.	0
106	O'MALLEY	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.	0
107	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
108	MUIR	All three candidates are weighing in.	0
109	SANDERS	Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.	0
110	SANDERS	You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails.	0
111	SANDERS	Right?	0
112	SANDERS	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.	0
113	SANDERS	Media notwithstanding.	0
114	SANDERS	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.	0
115	SANDERS	I hope those are the issues we'll discuss.	0
116	MUIR	Good let's move on -- Senator Sanders, let's move on right to some of those issues.	0
117	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
118	MUIR	It is just six days before Christmas, as we all know in this country.	0
119	MUIR	It's typically a joyful time, as it is this year, as well.	0
120	MUIR	But it's also an anxious time.	0
121	MUIR	President Obama has acknowledged that what we saw in San Bernardino was an act of terrorism.	0
122	MUIR	But we remember the president said, right before Thanksgiving, there is no known specific and credible intelligence indicating a plot on the homeland.	0
123	MUIR	We now know that this couple had assembled an arsenal.	0
124	MUIR	They were not on law enforcement's radar.	0
125	MUIR	They were completely undetected.	0
126	MUIR	So as we approach another holiday, with the president again saying, late this week, no credible threat, Secretary Clinton, how confident should the American people be, that there aren't others like that couple right now in the U.S. going undetected?	0
127	MUIR	And what would you do as president to find them?	0
128	CLINTON	Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.	0
129	CLINTON	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.	0
130	CLINTON	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.	0
131	CLINTON	And it has three parts.	0
132	CLINTON	First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.	0
133	CLINTON	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.	0
134	CLINTON	And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.	0
135	CLINTON	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.	0
136	CLINTON	Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground.	0
137	CLINTON	Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.	0
138	CLINTON	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.	0
139	CLINTON	We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information.	0
140	CLINTON	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.	0
141	CLINTON	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.	0
142	CLINTON	They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists.	0
143	CLINTON	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.	0
144	CLINTON	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.	0
145	CLINTON	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.	0
146	CLINTON	They will be our early warning signal.	0
147	CLINTON	That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.	0
148	O'MALLEY	David, I am the very first...	0
149	MUIR	(inaudible) thank you.	0
150	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
151	MUIR	I am the very first post-9/11 mayor and the very first post-9/11 governor.	0
152	MUIR	I understand, from the ground up, that when attacks like San Bernardino happen, when attacks like the attacks of 9/11 happen, that when people call 911, the first people to show up are the local first responders.	0
153	MUIR	Many of the things Secretary Clinton said are absolutely true, but they underscore a lack of investment that we have, as a nation, failed to make over these last 15 years in intelligence gathering, intelligence analysis, intelligence sharing.	0
154	MUIR	Not only in theater, in Syria and Iraq and other places where we embalk (ph) ourselves in toppling dictators without having any idea what comes next, but here in the homeland, as we protect people from this threat of the lone wolves and these changing tactics and strategies.	0
155	MUIR	I believe that what's happened here is that the president had us on the right course, but it's a lack of battle tempo.	0
156	MUIR	We have to increase the battle tempo, we have to bring a modern way of getting things done and forcing the sharing of information and do a much better job of acting on it in order to prevent these sorts of attacks in the future.	0
157	MUIR	And we're going to break down these issues tonight, but I do want to go to Senator Sanders because the concern going into Christmas is significant, as you know.	0
158	MUIR	A new ABC News poll shows 77 percent of Americans have little or no confidence in the government's ability to prevent a lone wolf attack.	0
159	MUIR	How would you specifically find would-be terrorist who are going undetected?	0
160	SANDERS	I'm one of the 77 percent.	0
161	SANDERS	I think this is a very difficult issue.	0
162	SANDERS	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.	0
163	SANDERS	Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.	0
164	SANDERS	I think it's a two-pronged issue.	0
165	SANDERS	Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS.	0
166	SANDERS	What is the best way to do it?	0
167	SANDERS	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.	0
168	SANDERS	I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.	0
169	SANDERS	I do not believe in unilateral American action.	0
170	SANDERS	I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations.	0
171	SANDERS	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.	0
172	SANDERS	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.	0
173	SANDERS	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.	0
174	SANDERS	"He said, ""Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam. We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."""	0
175	SANDERS	And I believe he is absolutely right.	0
176	MUIR	Senator, thank you.	0
177	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, in the wake of the San Bernardino attack, you all emphasized gun control.	0
178	RADDATZ	But our latest poll shows that more Americans believe arming people, not stricter gun laws, is the best defense against terrorism.	0
179	RADDATZ	Are they wrong?	0
180	CLINTON	Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.	0
181	CLINTON	Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.	0
182	CLINTON	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.	0
183	CLINTON	We've got to build a coalition abroad.	0
184	CLINTON	We also have to build a coalition at home.	0
185	CLINTON	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.	0
186	CLINTON	I know how hard that is.	0
187	CLINTON	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...	0
188	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, can we stick to gun control?	0
189	CLINTON	Yes, I'm getting...	0
190	RADDATZ	Are they wrong?	0
191	CLINTON	I'm getting to that.	0
192	CLINTON	Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home.	0
193	CLINTON	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.	0
194	CLINTON	We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.	1
195	CLINTON	I think what is...	0
196	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
197	CLINTON	Is creating much deeper, closer relations and, yes, coalitions within our own country.	0
198	CLINTON	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.	0
199	CLINTON	People who we should be welcoming and working with.	0
200	CLINTON	"I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a ""clash of civilizations,"" that there is some kind of Western plot or even ""war against Islam,"" which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization."	0
201	CLINTON	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.	0
202	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
203	RADDATZ	Senator Sanders -- wait just a moment, please, Governor O'Malley.	0
204	RADDATZ	Senator Sanders, we've seen those long lines of people buying guns in record numbers after the Paris attacks.	0
205	RADDATZ	Would you discourage people from buying a gun?	0
206	SANDERS	It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.	0
207	SANDERS	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.	0
208	SANDERS	That's the right of people.	0
209	SANDERS	But this is what I do believe.	0
210	SANDERS	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.	0
211	SANDERS	For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.	0
212	SANDERS	Who denies that it is crazy...	0
213	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
214	SANDERS	Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?	0
215	SANDERS	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.	0
216	SANDERS	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.	0
217	SANDERS	I think there is a consensus.	0
218	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
219	SANDERS	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.	0
220	SANDERS	It's a divided country on guns.	0
221	SANDERS	But there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that I, coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, will do my best to bring together.	0
222	O'MALLEY	Martha, if I may...	0
223	RADDATZ	Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
224	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
225	RADDATZ	I think we're going to go on...	0
226	O'MALLEY	Excuse me, no.	0
227	MUIR	Governor, we have to abide the rules here, we'll call on you here shortly, but...	0
228	O'MALLEY	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...	0
229	MUIR	But I do want pick up on something...	0
230	O'MALLEY	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.	0
231	O'MALLEY	And, look, there are profound differences...	0
232	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
233	O'MALLEY	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.	1
234	O'MALLEY	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.	1
235	O'MALLEY	And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.	1
236	O'MALLEY	Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.	1
237	O'MALLEY	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.	0
238	O'MALLEY	We need more principle.	0
239	O'MALLEY	When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up.	0
240	O'MALLEY	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.	0
241	RADDATZ	Governor, now -- and let me stay with gun control for a minute, then.	0
242	RADDATZ	You talk about assault weapons.	0
243	RADDATZ	Even if you were able to ban the purchase of assault weapons tomorrow, Americans already own an estimated 7 to 10 million semi-automatic rifles.	0
244	RADDATZ	Would you make it illegal to own those weapons, force people to turn them in?	0
245	RADDATZ	And if not, how would banning the sales really make a difference?	0
246	O'MALLEY	Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons.	0
247	O'MALLEY	You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...	0
248	RADDATZ	But, again, I'm not talking about buying.	0
249	RADDATZ	Would you have them confiscated?	0
250	RADDATZ	The ones that are already here?	0
251	O'MALLEY	No, Martha, I would not.	0
252	O'MALLEY	And that's not what we did in Maryland.	0
253	O'MALLEY	But you know what we did in Maryland?	0
254	O'MALLEY	We overcame the NRA's objections.	0
255	O'MALLEY	We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.	0
256	O'MALLEY	We did our own rallies.	0
257	O'MALLEY	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.	0
258	O'MALLEY	ISIL videos, ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show.	0
259	O'MALLEY	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.	0
260	SANDERS	Whoa, whoa, whoa.	0
261	SANDERS	Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.	0
262	CLINTON	Yes, let's tell the truth, Martin.	0
263	O'MALLEY	I am telling the truth.	0
264	SANDERS	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.	0
265	MUIR	We will.	0
266	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
267	SANDERS	All right.	0
268	MUIR	But let me just establish that for you, senator.	0
269	MUIR	Really quickly governor, we are going to call on you tonight and it's very clear you have a lot to say but please wait until you're called upon.	0
270	MUIR	And senator, he invoked your record and I'll let you respond.	0
271	SANDERS	He sure did.	0
272	MUIR	I'll let you respond.	0
273	CLINTON	He invoked mine as well.	0
274	MUIR	And you will get some to as well.	0
275	SANDERS	Sure did.	0
276	SANDERS	All right.	0
277	SANDERS	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.	0
278	SANDERS	In 1988, just to set the record straight governor, I ran for the U.S. House.	0
279	SANDERS	We have one House member from Vermont, three candidates in the race.	0
280	SANDERS	One candidate said, you know what, I don't think it's a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly.	0
281	SANDERS	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.	0
282	SANDERS	I lost that election by three percentage points.	0
283	SANDERS	Quite likely, for that reason.	0
284	SANDERS	So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.	0
285	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
286	SANDERS	Excuse me.	0
287	SANDERS	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.	0
288	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
289	MUIR	Senator, thank you.	0
290	MUIR	I want to move on here.	0
291	MUIR	Secretary Clinton, you brought up Donald Trump a short time ago.	0
292	CLINTON	I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well.	0
293	CLINTON	I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.	0
294	CLINTON	And I applaud his record in Maryland.	0
295	CLINTON	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.	0
296	CLINTON	I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.	0
297	CLINTON	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.	0
298	CLINTON	And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.	0
299	CLINTON	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.	0
300	CLINTON	And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity.	0
301	CLINTON	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.	0
302	CLINTON	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.	0
303	CLINTON	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.	0
304	CLINTON	And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.	0
305	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
306	MUIR	Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0
307	MUIR	We're going to move on from guns here and go back to something you mentioned a short time ago.	0
308	MUIR	You brought up Donald Trump first here this evening.	0
309	MUIR	We've now seen the polling done well after his proposed ban on Muslims coming to America.	0
310	MUIR	Thirty-six percent of Americans, more than a third, agree with him.	0
311	MUIR	You have weighed in already on Donald Trump.	0
312	MUIR	You've weighed in on the proposed ban.	0
313	MUIR	But what would you say to the millions of Americans watching tonight who agree with him?	0
314	MUIR	Are they wrong?	0
315	CLINTON	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.	0
316	CLINTON	First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.	0
317	CLINTON	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.	0
318	CLINTON	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.	0
319	CLINTON	We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear.	0
320	CLINTON	Making sure that Muslim Americans don't feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help.	0
321	CLINTON	You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks.	0
322	CLINTON	One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together.	0
323	CLINTON	You are not our adversary, you are our partner.	0
324	CLINTON	And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.	0
325	CLINTON	He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter.	0
326	CLINTON	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.	1
327	CLINTON	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.	0
328	MUIR	Secretary, thank you.	0
329	MUIR	Senator Sanders, I did want to ask you about a neighbor in San Bernardino who reportedly witnessed packages being delivered to that couple's home, that it set off red flags, but they didn't report it because they were afraid to profile.	0
330	MUIR	What would you say to Americans afraid to profile?	0
331	MUIR	Is it ever acceptable?	0
332	SANDERS	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.	0
333	SANDERS	That's kind of a no-brainer.	0
334	SANDERS	You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911.	0
335	SANDERS	Do it.	0
336	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
337	MUIR	But I'm asking about -- I'm asking about profiling.	0
338	MUIR	Because a lot of people are afraid of that.	0
339	SANDERS	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.	0
340	SANDERS	What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.	0
341	SANDERS	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.	0
342	SANDERS	They are anxious on a number of levels.	0
343	SANDERS	They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.	0
344	SANDERS	We all understand that.	0
345	SANDERS	But you know what else they're anxious about?	0
346	SANDERS	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.	0
347	SANDERS	And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?	0
348	SANDERS	What are you going to do for my kids?	0
349	SANDERS	"And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, ""I know the answers. The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans. Those are your enemies. We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists. We've got to hate the Muslims."""	0
350	SANDERS	Meanwhile, the rich get richer.	0
351	SANDERS	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.	0
352	SANDERS	He thinks low wages are a good idea.	0
353	SANDERS	I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.	0
354	SANDERS	Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top.	0
355	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
356	MUIR	Senator, thank you.	0
357	RADDATZ	I want to move to another...	0
358	O'MALLEY	Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...	0
359	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
360	RADDATZ	No, no, not yet, Governor O'Malley.	0
361	O'MALLEY	Can I share this quick story?	0
362	RADDATZ	No, not yet, Governor O'Malley.	0
363	O'MALLEY	Oh.	0
364	O'MALLEY	All right.	0
365	RADDATZ	I'll come to you when we call on you.	0
366	RADDATZ	Thank you very much.	0
367	O'MALLEY	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.	0
368	RADDATZ	You'll be happy.	0
369	RADDATZ	I'll let -- I'll let you talk then.	0
370	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, I want to talk about a new terrorist tool used in the Paris attacks, encryption.	0
371	RADDATZ	FBI Director James Comey says terrorists can hold secret communications which law enforcement cannot get to, even with a court order.	0
372	RADDATZ	You've talked a lot about bringing tech leaders and government officials together, but Apple CEO Tim Cook said removing encryption tools from our products altogether would only hurt law-abiding citizens who rely on us to protect their data.	0
373	RADDATZ	So would you force him to give law enforcement a key to encrypted technology by making it law?	0
374	CLINTON	I would not want to go to that point.	0
375	CLINTON	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.	0
376	CLINTON	It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.	0
377	CLINTON	There must be some way.	0
378	CLINTON	I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.	0
379	CLINTON	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.	0
380	CLINTON	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.	0
381	CLINTON	I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.	0
382	CLINTON	Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.	0
383	CLINTON	So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.	0
384	CLINTON	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.	0
385	RADDATZ	And Governor O'Malley, where do you draw the line between national security and personal security?	0
386	O'MALLEY	"I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security."	0
387	O'MALLEY	We need to figure this out together.	0
388	O'MALLEY	We need a collaborative approach.	0
389	O'MALLEY	We need new leadership.	0
390	O'MALLEY	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.	0
391	O'MALLEY	The federal government should have to get warrants.	0
392	O'MALLEY	That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.	0
393	O'MALLEY	"But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values."	0
394	O'MALLEY	"My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves."	0
395	O'MALLEY	He was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night.	0
396	O'MALLEY	And he is a proud American Muslim.	0
397	O'MALLEY	"And one of his little boys said to him, ""Dad, what happens if Donald Trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?"""	0
398	O'MALLEY	These are very, very real issues.	0
399	O'MALLEY	Тhis is a clear and present danger in our politics within.	0
400	O'MALLEY	"We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression."	0
401	O'MALLEY	"And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump."	0
402	RADDATZ	Thank you, Governor O'Malley.	0
403	MUIR	Martha, we're going to turn now to refugees coming to America.	0
404	MUIR	And on the subject of refugees, more than half of all Americans now say they oppose taking in refugees from Syria and across the Middle East.	0
405	MUIR	Secretary Clinton, you have said that it would undermine who we are as Americans, shutting our doors.	0
406	MUIR	But New Hampshire's governor, where we are right here tonight, a democrat and a supporter of yours, is among more than 30 governors who are now concerned.	0
407	MUIR	"Governor Maggie Hassan says, ""we should halt acceptance of Syrian refugees until U.S. authorities can assure the vetting process, halt Syrian refugees."""	0
408	MUIR	Is she wrong?	0
409	CLINTON	Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting...	0
410	MUIR	But a halt?	0
411	CLINTON	I don't think a halt is necessary.	0
412	CLINTON	What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening.	0
413	CLINTON	Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years.	0
414	CLINTON	So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.	0
415	CLINTON	But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.	0
416	CLINTON	Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.	0
417	CLINTON	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.	0
418	CLINTON	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.	0
419	CLINTON	And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go.	0
420	CLINTON	I would prioritize them.	0
421	CLINTON	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.	0
422	MUIR	Governor O'Malley, obviously you were governor yourself at one time.	0
423	MUIR	What would you say to New Hampshire's governor tonight?	0
424	MUIR	Is she wrong on this?	0
425	O'MALLEY	No, what I would say is this is look, I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept.	0
426	O'MALLEY	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.	0
427	MUIR	So the idea of a halt or a pause?	0
428	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
429	O'MALLEY	David, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees.	0
430	O'MALLEY	I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months.	0
431	O'MALLEY	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.	0
432	O'MALLEY	We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.	0
433	O'MALLEY	What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now.	0
434	O'MALLEY	The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators.	0
435	O'MALLEY	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.	0
436	MUIR	Governor, thank you.	0
437	RADDATZ	Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders, we're going to move on.	0
438	RADDATZ	We're going to move on.	0
439	SANDERS	Excuse me.	0
440	SANDERS	May I have a chance to respond to this issue?	0
441	RADDATZ	We're going to move on to the fight against ISIS.	0
442	RADDATZ	You're the one who told us we have to follow the rules and break it off.	0
443	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
444	SANDERS	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.	0
445	SANDERS	All right.	0
446	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
447	RADDATZ	OK. Let's keep going.	0
448	RADDATZ	Thank you.	0
449	SANDERS	All right.	0
450	SANDERS	Let's keep going.	0
451	SANDERS	OK.	0
452	RADDATZ	Thank you.	0
453	RADDATZ	I do want to move to the fight against ISIS.	0
454	SANDERS	Yeah.	0
455	RADDATZ	For the people of New Hampshire, the brutality of ISIS is personal.	0
456	RADDATZ	James Foley grew up here.	0
457	RADDATZ	The first hostage, a journalist, brutally executed last year.	0
458	RADDATZ	You've all said ISIS is a ruthless enemy and must be stopped.	0
459	RADDATZ	Al Qaida as well.	0
460	RADDATZ	Senator Sanders, you voted to send U.S. ground forces to fight in the coalition to help destroy Al Qaida in Afghanistan.	0
461	RADDATZ	Can you then explain you why don't support sending U.S. combat troops to join a coalition to fight ISIS?	0
462	SANDERS	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.	0
463	SANDERS	I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war.	0
464	SANDERS	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.	0
465	SANDERS	And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem.	0
466	RADDATZ	But why Al Qaida, why not ISIS?	0
467	SANDERS	I have a problem with that, Martha.	0
468	SANDERS	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.	0
469	SANDERS	But I agree, as I mentioned a moment ago, with King Abdullah.	0
470	SANDERS	This is a war for the soul of Islam.	0
471	SANDERS	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.	0
472	SANDERS	They should be Muslim troops.	0
473	SANDERS	I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.	0
474	RADDATZ	The administration has tried that over and over again.	0
475	RADDATZ	If it doesn't work and this threat is so great, what's your plan B?	0
476	SANDERS	My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.	0
477	SANDERS	To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep.	0
478	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
479	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, you too have ruled out a large U.S. combat force, yet you support sending in special operations forces to Syria, and sending those 100 to 200 troops to Iraq to do exploitation kill raids.	0
480	RADDATZ	We've already lost one Delta Force member in a raid.	0
481	RADDATZ	It has looked very much to me like we're already in ground combat on frequent trips I've made there.	0
482	RADDATZ	So, are you fooling Americans when you say, we're not putting American combat troops back into Syria or Iraq?	0
483	CLINTON	No.	0
484	CLINTON	Not at all.	0
485	CLINTON	I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated.	0
486	CLINTON	It was a different situation in Afghanistan.	0
487	CLINTON	We were attacked from Afghanistan.	0
488	CLINTON	Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan.	0
489	CLINTON	We went after those who had attacked us.	0
490	CLINTON	What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.	0
491	CLINTON	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.	0
492	CLINTON	They've advertised that.	0
493	CLINTON	They want American troops back in the Middle East.	0
494	CLINTON	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.	0
495	CLINTON	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.	0
496	CLINTON	And we do have to form a coalition.	0
497	CLINTON	I know how hard that is.	0
498	CLINTON	I have formed them.	0
499	CLINTON	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.	0
500	CLINTON	And you have to really work hard at it.	0
501	CLINTON	And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.	0
502	CLINTON	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.	0
503	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
504	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, I want -- I want to follow up on that.	0
505	RADDATZ	You do support sending special operations forces there.	0
506	RADDATZ	You support what the president has done already.	0
507	RADDATZ	One of the lessons people draw from Vietnam and war since is that a little force can turn into a little more and a little more.	0
508	RADDATZ	President Obama certainly didn't expect to be sending 30,000 additional troops into Afghanistan the first year of his presidency.	0
509	RADDATZ	Are you prepared to run the risk of a bigger war to achieve your goals to destroy ISIS, or are you prepared to give up on those goals if it requires a larger force?	0
510	CLINTON	Well, I just think you're asking a question with a false choice.	0
511	CLINTON	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.	0
512	CLINTON	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.	0
513	RADDATZ	Governor O'Malley.	0
514	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
515	RADDATZ	You've emphasized the need for more human intelligence on the ground.	0
516	RADDATZ	What is it our intelligence community is not doing now that needs to be done?	0
517	O'MALLEY	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.	0
518	O'MALLEY	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.	0
519	O'MALLEY	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.	0
520	O'MALLEY	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.	0
521	O'MALLEY	As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member.	0
522	O'MALLEY	We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said.	0
523	O'MALLEY	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.	0
524	O'MALLEY	They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq.	0
525	O'MALLEY	We cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because Martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail.	0
526	O'MALLEY	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.	0
527	O'MALLEY	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.	0
528	O'MALLEY	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.	0
529	CLINTON	Well, I just want to quickly add...	0
530	RADDATZ	Thank you.	0
531	CLINTON	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.	0
532	CLINTON	And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space.	0
533	CLINTON	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.	0
534	CLINTON	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.	0
535	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, I'd like to go back to that if I could.	0
536	RADDATZ	ISIS doesn't have aircraft, Al Qaida doesn't have aircraft.	0
537	RADDATZ	So would you shoot down a Syrian military aircraft or a Russian airplane?	0
538	CLINTON	I do not think it would come to that.	0
539	CLINTON	We are already de-conflicting air space.	0
540	CLINTON	We know...	0
541	RADDATZ	But isn't that a decision you should make now, whether...	0
542	CLINTON	No, I don't think so.	0
543	CLINTON	I am advocating...	0
544	RADDATZ	... if you're advocating this?	0
545	CLINTON	"I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia."	0
546	CLINTON	Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations.	0
547	CLINTON	The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia.	0
548	CLINTON	If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.	0
549	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
550	MUIR	I want to take this to Senator -- I'm going to take this to Senator Sanders next, because I think there...	0
551	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
552	SANDERS	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.	0
553	SANDERS	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.	0
554	SANDERS	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.	0
555	SANDERS	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.	0
556	SANDERS	I voted against the war.	0
557	SANDERS	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.	0
558	SANDERS	Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.	0
559	SANDERS	Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.	0
560	SANDERS	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.	0
561	SANDERS	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.	0
562	SANDERS	But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.	0
563	SANDERS	And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator.	0
564	SANDERS	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.	0
565	SANDERS	That's the secondary issue.	0
566	CLINTON	That is exactly...	0
567	MUIR	Senator, thank you.	0
568	CLINTON	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.	0
569	MUIR	Yeah, but, Secretary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton...	0
570	CLINTON	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.	0
571	CLINTON	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.	0
572	CLINTON	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.	0
573	CLINTON	All of these are very difficult issues.	0
574	CLINTON	"I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time."	0
575	CLINTON	And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned.	0
576	CLINTON	But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria.	0
577	CLINTON	Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.	0
578	SANDERS	I was not the secretary of state...	0
579	MUIR	Senator Sanders, Senator Sanders, hold on.	0
580	MUIR	One moment, please.	0
581	MUIR	I'm going to ask the secretary here, because there does appear to be some daylight here between the policies, at least in respect to when you take out Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.	0
582	MUIR	Right now or do you wait?	0
583	MUIR	Do you tackle ISIS first?	0
584	MUIR	You have said, Secretary Clinton, that you come to the conclusion that we have to proceed on both fronts at once.	0
585	MUIR	We heard from the senator just this week that we must put aside the issue of how quickly we get rid of Assad and come together with countries, including Russia and Iran, to destroy ISIS first.	0
586	MUIR	Is he wrong?	0
587	CLINTON	I think we're missing the point here.	0
588	CLINTON	We are doing both at the same time.	0
589	MUIR	But that's what he's saying, we should put that aside for now and go after ISIS.	0
590	CLINTON	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.	0
591	CLINTON	We now have that.	0
592	CLINTON	We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path.	0
593	CLINTON	It's very important we operate on both at the same time.	0
594	CLINTON	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.	0
595	CLINTON	I know how hard it is to build coalitions.	0
596	CLINTON	I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.	0
597	CLINTON	That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.	0
598	CLINTON	The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria, linking with Hezbollah, their proxy in Lebanon, would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future.	0
599	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
600	SANDERS	I happen to think...	0
601	O'MALLEY	I'd like to offer a...	0
602	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
603	MUIR	She says we have to proceed on both fronts at once.	0
604	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton is right.	0
605	SANDERS	This is a complicated issue.	0
606	SANDERS	I don't think anyone has a magical solution.	0
607	SANDERS	But this is what I do believe.	0
608	SANDERS	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.	0
609	SANDERS	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.	0
610	SANDERS	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.	0
611	SANDERS	It is ISIS.	0
612	SANDERS	And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.	0
613	SANDERS	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.	0
614	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
615	SANDERS	And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS.	0
616	SANDERS	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.	0
617	SANDERS	First priority, destroy ISIS.	0
618	MUIR	Senator sanders, thank you.	0
619	O'MALLEY	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?	0
620	MUIR	Governor O'Malley?	0
621	O'MALLEY	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.	0
622	O'MALLEY	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.	0
623	O'MALLEY	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.	0
624	O'MALLEY	And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that.	0
625	O'MALLEY	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.	0
626	O'MALLEY	I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart.	0
627	O'MALLEY	And the world, no doubt is a better place without him.	0
628	O'MALLEY	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.	0
629	O'MALLEY	And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.	0
630	O'MALLEY	We have a role to play in this world.	0
631	O'MALLEY	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.	0
632	MUIR	But -- you criticized -- you criticized Secretary Clinton for what came next.	0
633	MUIR	What's your proposal for what comes after Assad?	0
634	O'MALLEY	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.	0
635	O'MALLEY	That is the clear and present danger.	0
636	O'MALLEY	And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.	0
637	O'MALLEY	But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.	0
638	O'MALLEY	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?	0
639	O'MALLEY	We have a role to play in this world.	0
640	O'MALLEY	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.	0
641	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
642	SANDERS	David...	0
643	CLINTON	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.	0
644	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
645	CLINTON	I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.	0
646	CLINTON	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.	0
647	CLINTON	I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now.	0
648	CLINTON	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.	0
649	CLINTON	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.	0
650	CLINTON	No.	0
651	CLINTON	We now finally are where we need to be.	0
652	CLINTON	We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS, which is a danger to us as well as the region...	0
653	SANDERS	Secretary...	0
654	CLINTON	And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.	0
655	SANDERS	Could I just say -- just say this...	0
656	CLINTON	If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader.	0
657	CLINTON	There is a vacuum.	0
658	SANDERS	Can I just say this...	0
659	CLINTON	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.	0
660	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
661	MUIR	Senator Sanders, please.	0
662	MUIR	Go ahead.	0
663	MUIR	Senator Sanders, a last word on this.	0
664	SANDERS	Of course the United States must lead.	0
665	SANDERS	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.	0
666	SANDERS	The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.	0
667	SANDERS	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.	0
668	SANDERS	ISIS, now, is the major priority.	0
669	SANDERS	Let's get rid of Assad later.	0
670	SANDERS	Let's have a Democratic Syria.	0
671	SANDERS	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.	0
672	MUIR	Senator Sanders, thank you.	0
673	SANDERS	When we come back here tonight, the other major issues of this election: jobs, the economy, health care.	0
674	SANDERS	Which candidates will make the best case for the middle class, as our coverage of the Democratic debate, here in New Hampshire, continues right after this on ABC.	0
675	SYSTEM	ABC News coverage of the New Hampshire Democratic debate will continue in a moment.	0
676	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
677	MUIR	Welcome back tonight.	0
678	MUIR	As you can see, we have a packed audience here in New Hampshire and we're going to continue.	0
679	MUIR	We've already had a spirited conversation here at the top of the broadcast about ISIS, about the concerns of terror here on the homefront and as we await Secretary Clinton backstage, we're going to begin on the economy.	0
680	MUIR	We want to turn to the American jobs, wages and raises in this country.	0
681	MUIR	And we believe Secretary Clinton will be coming around the corner any minute.	0
682	MUIR	But in the mean time we want to start with this eye-opening number.	0
683	MUIR	And Senator Sanders, this question goes to you first, anyway.	0
684	MUIR	In 1995, the median American household income was $52,600 in today's money.	0
685	MUIR	This year, it's $53,600.	0
686	MUIR	That's 20 more years on the job with just a 2 percent raise.	0
687	MUIR	In a similar time-frame, raises for CEOs went up more than 200 percent.	0
688	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
689	CLINTON	Sorry.	0
690	MUIR	We're going to continue here, and Secretary, you'll get a chance on this too.	0
691	MUIR	But as I pointed out the CEO pay, 200 percent of their time -- for that family of just 2 percent.	0
692	MUIR	"You've all said, ""you would raise the minimum wage."""	0
693	MUIR	But Senator Sanders what else - speak to that household tonight.	0
694	MUIR	20 years, just a 2 percent raise, how as president would you get them a raise right away?	0
695	SANDERS	First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated.	0
696	SANDERS	"Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?"	0
697	SANDERS	Absolutely.	0
698	SANDERS	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.	0
699	SANDERS	So what do we do?	0
700	SANDERS	"First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, ""they cannot have it all."""	0
701	SANDERS	For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes.	0
702	SANDERS	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.	0
703	SANDERS	Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.	0
704	SANDERS	Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.	0
705	SANDERS	Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.	0
706	SANDERS	We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.	0
707	SANDERS	Furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world.	0
708	SANDERS	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.	0
709	MUIR	Senator Sanders, thank you.	0
710	MUIR	Governor O'Malley, what would propose that would be different, how would you get the middle class a raise and without waiting another 20 years for another 2 percent.	0
711	O'MALLEY	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.	0
712	O'MALLEY	We actually passed a living wage.	0
713	O'MALLEY	We raised the minimum wage.	0
714	O'MALLEY	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.	0
715	O'MALLEY	All through the recession, we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African American families.	0
716	O'MALLEY	How?	0
717	O'MALLEY	By actually doing more for education.	0
718	O'MALLEY	We increased education funding by 37 percent.	0
719	O'MALLEY	We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.	0
720	O'MALLEY	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.	0
721	O'MALLEY	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.	0
722	O'MALLEY	"So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there."	0
723	O'MALLEY	We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families.	0
724	O'MALLEY	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.	0
725	O'MALLEY	And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.	0
726	MUIR	Governor, thank you.	0
727	MUIR	Secretary Clinton...	0
728	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
729	MUIR	As you were walking in, I was talking about the median American household getting a two percent raise over the last 20 years, that CEO pay in that same time frame has gone up 200 percent.	0
730	MUIR	So for those families watching tonight, how do you get them a raise if you're president?	0
731	CLINTON	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.	0
732	CLINTON	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.	0
733	CLINTON	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.	0
734	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
735	CLINTON	They don't want to raise the minimum wage, they don't want to do anything to increase incomes.	1
736	CLINTON	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.	0
737	CLINTON	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.	0
738	CLINTON	Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.	0
739	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
740	CLINTON	And we've got to do more on equal pay for equal work.	0
741	CLINTON	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.	0
742	CLINTON	That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.	0
743	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
744	CLINTON	And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.	0
745	CLINTON	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.	0
746	CLINTON	I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.	0
747	CLINTON	And there's a lot.	0
748	CLINTON	You can go to my website...	0
749	MUIR	Secretary...	0
750	CLINTON	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.	0
751	CLINTON	But I guess the final thing that -- that I would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall.	0
752	MUIR	Secretary, thank you.	0
753	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
754	CLINTON	This is the election...	0
755	MUIR	We're going to -- we're going to...	0
756	CLINTON	... issues they have to respond to.	0
757	MUIR	And we're going to talk about college education in a moment.	0
758	MUIR	But Secretary Clinton, I did want to ask you, the last time you ran for president, Fortune Magazine put you on its cover with the headline Business Loves Hillary, pointing out your support for many CEOs in corporate America.	0
759	MUIR	I'm curious, eight years later, should corporate America love Hillary Clinton?	0
760	CLINTON	Everybody should.	0
761	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
762	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
763	CLINTON	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.	0
764	CLINTON	I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing.	0
765	CLINTON	I want the Buffett Rule to be in effect, where millionaires have to pay 30 percent tax rates instead of 10 percent to nothing in some cases.	0
766	CLINTON	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.	0
767	CLINTON	But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.	0
768	CLINTON	I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.	0
769	CLINTON	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.	0
770	CLINTON	I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.	0
771	CLINTON	So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.	0
772	MUIR	Secretary, thank you.	0
773	MUIR	Senator Sanders...	0
774	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
775	MUIR	I want to stay on this and ask you how big a role does corporate America play in a healthy economy and will corporate America love a President Sanders?	0
776	SANDERS	No, I think they won't.	0
777	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
778	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
779	SANDERS	So Hillary and I have a difference.	0
780	SANDERS	The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary.	0
781	SANDERS	They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.	0
782	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
783	SANDERS	And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.	0
784	SANDERS	When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.	0
785	SANDERS	So I don't think...	0
786	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
787	SANDERS	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.	0
788	SANDERS	I don't have a super PAC.	0
789	SANDERS	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.	0
790	SANDERS	And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans.	0
791	SANDERS	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.	0
792	MUIR	Senator, thank you.	0
793	MUIR	I want to...	0
794	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
795	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
796	MUIR	Governor, let me just ask you, though, because it is an important question, how important a role do you think corporate America plays in a healthy economy here in the U.S.?	0
797	O'MALLEY	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.	0
798	O'MALLEY	And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.	0
799	O'MALLEY	And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that.	0
800	O'MALLEY	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.	0
801	O'MALLEY	We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.	0
802	O'MALLEY	And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has.	0
803	O'MALLEY	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.	0
804	O'MALLEY	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.	0
805	O'MALLEY	There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.	0
806	O'MALLEY	And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.	1
807	O'MALLEY	And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.	0
808	O'MALLEY	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...	0
809	CLINTON	OK...	0
810	MUIR	Governor O'Malley, thank you.	0
811	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
812	MUIR	I do want to ask you, Secretary Clinton.	0
813	MUIR	Let me just ask you...	0
814	CLINTON	Let me respond...	0
815	MUIR	We did -- we did -- Secretary Clinton, let me just ask you...	0
816	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
817	CLINTON	Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.	0
818	CLINTON	Number one...	0
819	MUIR	And in particular...	0
820	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
821	CLINTON	Number one, there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire.	0
822	CLINTON	They started in Iowa.	0
823	CLINTON	Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?	0
824	CLINTON	And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda.	0
825	CLINTON	Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.	1
826	CLINTON	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.	0
827	CLINTON	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.	1
828	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
829	CLINTON	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.	0
830	CLINTON	And he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor.	0
831	CLINTON	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.	0
832	CLINTON	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.	0
833	CLINTON	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.	0
834	CLINTON	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.	0
835	SANDERS	Let me just -- let me just...	0
836	MUIR	Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0
837	SANDERS	Let me just jump in.	0
838	SANDERS	My name was invoked.	0
839	MUIR	Senator?	0
840	SANDERS	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.	0
841	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
842	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC.	0
843	SANDERS	I don't get any money from Wall Street.	0
844	SANDERS	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.	0
845	SANDERS	But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.	0
846	SANDERS	I'll advertise my Web site as well.	0
847	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
848	SANDERS	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.	0
849	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
850	SANDERS	Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies.	0
851	SANDERS	What a brilliant idea that would be.	0
852	SANDERS	Go to YouTube.	0
853	SANDERS	Find out what I said to Greenspan.	0
854	SANDERS	At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.	0
855	SANDERS	Wall Street today has too much political power.	0
856	SANDERS	It has too much economic power.	0
857	SANDERS	To get deregulated -- listen to this, they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10-year period.	0
858	MUIR	Senator Sanders...	0
859	SANDERS	Wall Street is a threat to the economy.	0
860	SANDERS	They've got to be broken up.	0
861	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
862	MUIR	Thank you, Senator.	0
863	RADDATZ	And we're going to move on to health care.	0
864	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton, the Department of Health and Human Services says more than 17 million Americans who are not insured now have health coverage because of Obamacare.	0
865	SANDERS	But for Americans who already had health insurance the cost has gone up 27 percent in the last five years while deductibles are up 67 percent, health care costs are rising faster than many Americans can manage.	0
866	SANDERS	What's broken in Obamacare that needs to be fixed right now?	0
867	SANDERS	And what would you do to fix it?	0
868	CLINTON	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.	0
869	CLINTON	Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.	0
870	CLINTON	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.	0
871	CLINTON	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.	0
872	CLINTON	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.	0
873	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
874	CLINTON	Those are all really positive developments.	0
875	CLINTON	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.	0
876	CLINTON	And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.	0
877	CLINTON	Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems.	0
878	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
879	CLINTON	We end up paying the highest prices in the world.	0
880	CLINTON	And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.	0
881	CLINTON	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.	0
882	CLINTON	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.	0
883	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
884	RADDATZ	But you did say those were glitches.	0
885	CLINTON	Yes.	0
886	RADDATZ	Just glitches?	0
887	CLINTON	Well, they're glitches because...	0
888	RADDATZ	Twenty-seven percent in the last five years, deductibles up 67 percent?	0
889	CLINTON	It is.	0
890	CLINTON	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.	0
891	CLINTON	We have fought, as Democrats, for decades to get a health care plan.	0
892	CLINTON	I know.	0
893	CLINTON	I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s.	0
894	CLINTON	We want to build on it and fix it.	0
895	CLINTON	And I'm confident we can do that.	0
896	CLINTON	And it will have effects in the private market.	0
897	CLINTON	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.	0
898	CLINTON	And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals.	0
899	CLINTON	Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.	0
900	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
901	RADDATZ	Senator Sanders, I want you to respond to what she was saying, but you're instead calling for single-payer health care.	0
902	SANDERS	Yes, exactly, exactly.	0
903	RADDATZ	You note people won't have to pay deductibles or premiums but they will have to pay new taxes.	0
904	RADDATZ	Can you tell us specifically how much people will be expected to pay?	0
905	SANDERS	Yes, well, roughly.	0
906	SANDERS	Let me say this.	0
907	SANDERS	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.	0
908	SANDERS	Seventeen more million more people have health care.	0
909	SANDERS	It is a step forward.	0
910	SANDERS	A step forward.	0
911	SANDERS	But this is what we also have to say.	0
912	SANDERS	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.	0
913	SANDERS	Major crisis and primary health care.	0
914	SANDERS	Here is the bottom line.	0
915	SANDERS	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?	0
916	SANDERS	Why is it...	0
917	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
918	SANDERS	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.	0
919	SANDERS	Bottom line.	0
920	SANDERS	This ties into campaign finance reform.	0
921	SANDERS	The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.	0
922	SANDERS	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.	0
923	SANDERS	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.	0
924	RADDATZ	Senator Sanders, you didn't really tell us specifically how much people will be expected to pay...	0
925	SANDERS	But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.	0
926	SANDERS	So it's unfair to say in total...	0
927	RADDATZ	But you can't tell us this specifically, even if you were...	0
928	SANDERS	I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance.	0
929	SANDERS	The average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.	0
930	RADDATZ	OK.	0
931	RADDATZ	Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque.	0
932	RADDATZ	Neil?	0
933	LEVESQUE	Here to New Hampshire again.	0
934	LEVESQUE	As you know, this auditorium is filled with many Saint Anselm college students.	0
935	LEVESQUE	They know the outstanding student debt right now in America is $1.3 trillion.	0
936	LEVESQUE	That private education costs have gone up in the last decade 26 percent, and 40 percent for public education.	0
937	LEVESQUE	So knowing that, we know you want to make public education more affordable but how do you really lower the cost?	0
938	LEVESQUE	Senator Sanders, you mentioned a few minutes ago that you want free tuition for public colleges.	0
939	SANDERS	And universities.	0
940	LEVESQUE	How does that really lower the cost other than just shifting the cost to taxpayers?	0
941	SANDERS	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.	0
942	SANDERS	And your point is absolutely well taken.	0
943	SANDERS	The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.	0
944	SANDERS	There are a lot of factors involved in that.	0
945	SANDERS	And that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums.	0
946	SANDERS	Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.	0
947	SANDERS	But...	0
948	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
949	SANDERS	And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.	0
950	SANDERS	But, bottom line is this is the year 2015.	0
951	SANDERS	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.	0
952	SANDERS	It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.	0
953	SANDERS	Millions coming out of school as you indicated, deeply in debt.	0
954	SANDERS	What do we do?	0
955	SANDERS	My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt.	0
956	SANDERS	You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.	0
957	SANDERS	What sense is that?	0
958	SANDERS	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.	0
959	SANDERS	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.	0
960	SANDERS	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.	0
961	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
962	LEVESQUE	Governor O'Malley, how do you propose -- Governor O'Malley, how do you propose lowering some of these costs associated with higher education?	0
963	O'MALLEY	Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this.	0
964	O'MALLEY	As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.	0
965	O'MALLEY	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.	0
966	O'MALLEY	So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants.	0
967	O'MALLEY	Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.	0
968	O'MALLEY	But states need to do more as well.	0
969	O'MALLEY	And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well.	0
970	O'MALLEY	I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.	0
971	O'MALLEY	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.	0
972	O'MALLEY	My oldest daughter's a teacher.	0
973	O'MALLEY	Man (ph), their mother's here as well.	0
974	O'MALLEY	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?	0
975	O'MALLEY	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.	0
976	O'MALLEY	I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.	0
977	O'MALLEY	There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.	0
978	O'MALLEY	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.	0
979	O'MALLEY	Bill.	0
980	O'MALLEY	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.	0
981	O'MALLEY	That's a drag on the economy.	0
982	O'MALLEY	It's one of the key investments we need to make.	0
983	O'MALLEY	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.	0
984	O'MALLEY	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.	0
985	MUIR	Secretary Clinton.	0
986	CLINTON	Right.	0
987	MCELVEEN	Secretary Clinton, how does your plan differentiate from your opponents?	0
988	CLINTON	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.	0
989	CLINTON	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.	0
990	CLINTON	Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.	0
991	CLINTON	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.	0
992	CLINTON	"So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education."	0
993	CLINTON	So under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system.	0
994	CLINTON	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.	0
995	CLINTON	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.	0
996	CLINTON	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.	0
997	CLINTON	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.	0
998	CLINTON	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.	0
999	CLINTON	Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.	0
1000	CLINTON	And I have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run.	0
1001	CLINTON	"And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college."	0
1002	MCELVEEN	Thank you Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0
1003	SANDERS	May I respond to the critique on the ...	0
1004	MCELVEEN	Back to you David.	0
1005	MUIR	We're going to get right into this Senator but I want to ask about taxes next.	0
1006	MUIR	This is included.	0
1007	SANDERS	I would just...	0
1008	MUIR	She was asking about that...	0
1009	SANDERS	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.	0
1010	SANDERS	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.	0
1011	SANDERS	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.	0
1012	SANDERS	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.	0
1013	CLINTON	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...	0
1014	MUIR	Are we back on health care - Secretary Clinton hold one moment.	0
1015	MUIR	Senator Sanders...	0
1016	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1017	CLINTON	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.	0
1018	MUIR	Secretary Clinton, please.	0
1019	CLINTON	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.	0
1020	CLINTON	I'm the only person...	0
1021	MUIR	So let's ask about it.	0
1022	MUIR	Secretary Clinton, let's turn to the taxes.	0
1023	CLINTON	... saying, no middle class tax raises.	0
1024	CLINTON	That's off the table...	0
1025	MUIR	This is where we are going next, we are going next to taxes here...	0
1026	SANDERS	Now, this is getting to be fun.	0
1027	MUIR	This is fun.	0
1028	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1029	MUIR	This is democracy at work.	0
1030	MUIR	"Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about your tax plan because from the crushing cost of college education, the next question most families have; is will my taxes go up under the next president?"	0
1031	MUIR	You have said it's your goal not to raise taxes on families making under $200,000 a year a goal.	0
1032	MUIR	But can you say that's a promise as you stand here tonight?	0
1033	CLINTON	That is a pledge that I'm making.	0
1034	CLINTON	I made it when I ran in 2008.	0
1035	MUIR	A promise?	0
1036	CLINTON	Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made.	0
1037	CLINTON	Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.	0
1038	CLINTON	We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.	0
1039	CLINTON	Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody.	0
1040	CLINTON	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.	0
1041	SANDERS	Let me respond to...	0
1042	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1043	MUIR	Secretary Clinton...	0
1044	SANDERS	Let me respond to...	0
1045	MUIR	Please.	0
1046	SANDERS	Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.	0
1047	SANDERS	"Now, when Secretary Clinton says, ""I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class,"" let me tell you what she is saying."	0
1048	SANDERS	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.	0
1049	SANDERS	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.	0
1050	SANDERS	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.	0
1051	SANDERS	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.	0
1052	SANDERS	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.	0
1053	MUIR	Senator, thank you.	0
1054	MUIR	Let me bring in Governor O'Malley...	0
1055	CLINTON	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...	0
1056	MUIR	You've heard...	0
1057	CLINTON	... family leave for a very long time...	0
1058	MUIR	Secretary Clinton.	0
1059	SANDERS	David, thank you.	0
1060	CLINTON	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...	0
1061	SANDERS	Then (inaudible)...	0
1062	CLINTON	... not everybody else.	0
1063	SANDERS	Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rosa DeLauro, got ears (ph) to legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave.	0
1064	MUIR	Thank you.	0
1065	MUIR	I want to bring in Governor O'Malley on this.	0
1066	MUIR	We heard the promise from Secretary Clinton because people want to know about their taxes, will they go up.	0
1067	MUIR	She has now promised here tonight not to raise them on families making $250,000 or less.	0
1068	MUIR	Can you make that same promise if you're elected?	0
1069	O'MALLEY	No, I've never made a promise like that.	0
1070	O'MALLEY	But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year.	0
1071	O'MALLEY	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.	0
1072	O'MALLEY	By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.	0
1073	O'MALLEY	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.	0
1074	O'MALLEY	David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.	0
1075	O'MALLEY	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.	0
1076	O'MALLEY	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.	0
1077	O'MALLEY	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.	0
1078	O'MALLEY	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.	0
1079	O'MALLEY	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.	0
1080	O'MALLEY	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.	0
1081	MUIR	Governor O'Malley, thank you.	0
1082	MUIR	A spirited debate on taxes.	0
1083	MUIR	And there will be more with the Democratic debate in New Hampshire, when we come back right here on ABC.	0
1084	MUIR	More in a moment.	0
1085	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
1086	MUIR	Welcome back tonight to New Hampshire.	0
1087	MUIR	The Democratic debate continues here on ABC.	0
1088	MUIR	And Secretary Clinton, we want to turn to race, now, in America.	0
1089	MUIR	There is a real concern in this country from Black Lives Matter and from other community groups that we're just now seeing, with smartphones and cell phones, what many have been dealing with for years when they come in contact with police.	0
1090	MUIR	But you also have many in law enforcement who now say there has been a so-called Ferguson effect, police holding back because they're afraid of backlash.	0
1091	MUIR	In fact, the FBI director is calling it a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement.	0
1092	MUIR	So, if elected president, how would you bridge the divide between the two?	0
1093	CLINTON	Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country.	0
1094	CLINTON	We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.	0
1095	CLINTON	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.	0
1096	CLINTON	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.	0
1097	CLINTON	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.	0
1098	CLINTON	The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murders.	0
1099	CLINTON	The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.	0
1100	CLINTON	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.	0
1101	CLINTON	We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.	0
1102	CLINTON	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.	0
1103	MUIR	Secretary, thank you.	0
1104	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1105	MUIR	Governor O'Malley, how would you bridge the divide?	0
1106	O'MALLEY	There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America.	0
1107	O'MALLEY	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.	0
1108	O'MALLEY	But we came together.	0
1109	O'MALLEY	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.	0
1110	O'MALLEY	And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.	0
1111	O'MALLEY	As governor, we continued to work together.	0
1112	O'MALLEY	We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.	0
1113	O'MALLEY	But get this.	0
1114	O'MALLEY	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.	0
1115	O'MALLEY	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.	0
1116	O'MALLEY	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.	0
1117	O'MALLEY	We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force.	0
1118	O'MALLEY	In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.	0
1119	O'MALLEY	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.	0
1120	O'MALLEY	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.	0
1121	O'MALLEY	There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.	0
1122	O'MALLEY	We need to do it now as a nation.	0
1123	O'MALLEY	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.	0
1124	MUIR	Governor, thank you.	0
1125	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1126	MUIR	And Senator Sanders, when you hear the FBI director calling it a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement, does that concern you as well when you --	0
1127	SANDERS	Well, this whole issue concerns me.	0
1128	SANDERS	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.	0
1129	SANDERS	But let's be clear.	0
1130	SANDERS	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.	0
1131	SANDERS	Predominantly African-American and Hispanic.	0
1132	SANDERS	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.	0
1133	SANDERS	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.	0
1134	SANDERS	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.	0
1135	SANDERS	Now, what does that mean?	0
1136	SANDERS	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.	0
1137	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1138	SANDERS	It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.	0
1139	SANDERS	So that it will not be a federal crime.	0
1140	SANDERS	That is why we need to make...	0
1141	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1142	SANDERS	That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor.	0
1143	SANDERS	I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.	0
1144	SANDERS	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.	0
1145	SANDERS	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.	0
1146	SANDERS	We need to end minimal sentencing.	0
1147	SANDERS	We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.	0
1148	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1149	MUIR	Senator, thank you.	0
1150	MUIR	We want to turn now to an issue.	0
1151	MUIR	This next issue has destroyed so many families across the country, and in particular right here in New Hampshire, heroin.	0
1152	MUIR	And there's a stunning new figure out.	0
1153	MUIR	A recent poll -- 48 percent here, in this state alone, say they know someone who has abused heroin.	0
1154	MUIR	We're going to turn tonight to Dan Tuohy of the New Hampshire Union Leader who has this question.	0
1155	QUESTION	New Hampshire has been hard hit by the heroin epidemic, and we're on track to have twice as many overdose deaths this year as in 2013.	0
1156	QUESTION	What specifically would you do to address this crisis?	0
1157	MUIR	Senator Sanders, I'm going to take this to you first because you've seen what's happened with heroin right on the border in your own state.	0
1158	SANDERS	Yes.	0
1159	SANDERS	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.	0
1160	SANDERS	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.	0
1161	SANDERS	It is a tragedy all over this country.	0
1162	SANDERS	The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly.	0
1163	SANDERS	What do we do?	0
1164	SANDERS	Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.	0
1165	SANDERS	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.	0
1166	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1167	SANDERS	And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.	0
1168	SANDERS	When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help.	0
1169	SANDERS	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.	0
1170	SANDERS	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.	0
1171	MUIR	Senator, thank you.	0
1172	MUIR	Secretary Clinton?	0
1173	CLINTON	You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?	0
1174	CLINTON	And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose.	0
1175	CLINTON	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.	0
1176	CLINTON	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.	0
1177	CLINTON	I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do.	0
1178	CLINTON	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.	0
1179	CLINTON	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.	0
1180	CLINTON	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.	0
1181	CLINTON	I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.	0
1182	CLINTON	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.	0
1183	CLINTON	There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction.	0
1184	CLINTON	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.	0
1185	CLINTON	And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.	0
1186	MUIR	Secretary, thank you.	0
1187	O'MALLEY	And you know, I actually know a great deal about this issue.	0
1188	O'MALLEY	And I have a dear friend, played music with him for years, remember when his -- when he came home with his baby girl, and now she's no longer with us, because of addiction and overdose.	0
1189	O'MALLEY	The last time in New Hampshire, I had to take a break shortly after landing and call home and comfort a friend whose mother had died of an overdose.	0
1190	O'MALLEY	Drugs have taken far too many of our citizens.	0
1191	O'MALLEY	It's a huge public health challenge.	0
1192	O'MALLEY	In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.	0
1193	O'MALLEY	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.	0
1194	O'MALLEY	I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.	0
1195	O'MALLEY	We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital.	0
1196	O'MALLEY	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.	0
1197	O'MALLEY	That's what I said to my own public health people.	0
1198	O'MALLEY	What would we do if this were ebola?	0
1199	O'MALLEY	How would we act?	0
1200	O'MALLEY	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.	0
1201	O'MALLEY	There are thing that can be done.	0
1202	O'MALLEY	Go on to my website.	0
1203	O'MALLEY	My plan is there.	0
1204	O'MALLEY	It's one of 15 strategic goals I've set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years.	0
1205	MUIR	Governor O'Malley, thank you.	0
1206	MUIR	Martha?	0
1207	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1208	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, I want to circle back to something that your opponents here have brought up.	0
1209	RADDATZ	Libya is falling apart.	0
1210	RADDATZ	The country is a haven for ISIS and jihadists with an estimated 2,000 ISIS fighters there today.	0
1211	RADDATZ	You advocated for that 2011 intervention and called it smart power at its best.	0
1212	RADDATZ	And yet, even President Obama said the U.S. should have done more to fill the leadership vacuum left behind.	0
1213	RADDATZ	How much responsibility do you bear for the chaos that followed elections?	0
1214	CLINTON	Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.	0
1215	CLINTON	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.	0
1216	CLINTON	I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path.	0
1217	CLINTON	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.	0
1218	CLINTON	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.	0
1219	CLINTON	You know, this is not easy work.	0
1220	CLINTON	We did a lot to help.	0
1221	CLINTON	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.	0
1222	CLINTON	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.	0
1223	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, I want to go back.	0
1224	RADDATZ	That -- government lacked institutions and experience.	0
1225	RADDATZ	It had been a family business for 40 years.	0
1226	RADDATZ	On the security side, we offered only a modest training effort and a very limited arms buy-back program.	0
1227	RADDATZ	Let me ask you the question again.	0
1228	RADDATZ	How much responsibility do you bear for the chaos that followed those elections?	0
1229	CLINTON	Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take.	0
1230	CLINTON	We offered a lot more.	0
1231	CLINTON	We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up.	0
1232	CLINTON	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.	0
1233	CLINTON	I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.	0
1234	CLINTON	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.	0
1235	CLINTON	We've been at this a couple of years.	0
1236	RADDATZ	But were mistakes made?	0
1237	CLINTON	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.	0
1238	CLINTON	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.	0
1239	CLINTON	What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.	0
1240	SANDERS	But what...	0
1241	RADDATZ	Senator Sanders.	0
1242	SANDERS	Look, the secretary is right.	0
1243	SANDERS	This is a terribly complicated issue.	0
1244	SANDERS	There are no simple solutions.	0
1245	SANDERS	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.	0
1246	SANDERS	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.	0
1247	SANDERS	So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.	0
1248	SANDERS	I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.	0
1249	O'MALLEY	Martha -- I would just repeat that --	0
1250	CLINTON	Well, I would just repeat that.	0
1251	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton.	0
1252	CLINTON	Wait a minute.	0
1253	CLINTON	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.	0
1254	CLINTON	We got a U.N. Security council vote.	0
1255	CLINTON	Now, I understand that this is very difficult.	0
1256	CLINTON	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.	0
1257	CLINTON	We saw what happened in Egypt.	0
1258	CLINTON	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.	0
1259	CLINTON	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.	0
1260	CLINTON	One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.	0
1261	CLINTON	That's a hard road to walk.	0
1262	CLINTON	But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.	0
1263	O'MALLEY	And Martha...	0
1264	RADDATZ	Quick Governor O'Malley.	0
1265	O'MALLEY	... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.	0
1266	O'MALLEY	And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.	0
1267	O'MALLEY	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.	0
1268	O'MALLEY	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.	0
1269	O'MALLEY	But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.	0
1270	O'MALLEY	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.	0
1271	O'MALLEY	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.	0
1272	O'MALLEY	We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.	0
1273	RADDATZ	Thank you very much.	0
1274	RADDATZ	Thank you.	0
1275	RADDATZ	We're going to move on here.	0
1276	RADDATZ	Governor O'Malley, thank you very much for that.	0
1277	RADDATZ	And we're going to make a very sharp turn as we wrap things up here.	0
1278	RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, first ladies, as you well know, have used their position to work on important causes like literacy and drug abuse.	0
1279	RADDATZ	But they also supervise the menus, the flowers, the holiday ornaments and White House decor.	0
1280	RADDATZ	I know you think you know where I'm going here.	0
1281	RADDATZ	You have said that Bill Clinton is a great host and loves giving tours but may opt out of picking flower arrangements if you're elected.	0
1282	RADDATZ	Bill Clinton aside, is it time to change the role of a president's spouse?	0
1283	CLINTON	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.	0
1284	CLINTON	And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.	0
1285	CLINTON	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.	0
1286	CLINTON	And I think has had a big impact.	0
1287	CLINTON	So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.	0
1288	CLINTON	And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.	0
1289	CLINTON	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.	0
1290	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1291	CLINTON	Democrats discuss presidential spouses.	0
1292	CLINTON	Candidates Hillary Clinton, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders talk about the roles their spouses would play in helping run the Oval Office (ABC News).	0
1293	MUIR	I do want to follow up here for each of you.	0
1294	MUIR	And a similar line of questioning.	0
1295	MUIR	Senator Sanders, your wife Jane shares an office at your campaign headquarters in Burlington.	0
1296	MUIR	We've seen the pictures, the desks right next to each other.	0
1297	MUIR	Would she have a desk close by in the west wing?	0
1298	SANDERS	Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me, yes, she would.	0
1299	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1300	SANDERS	And let me, by the way, take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady, but redefined what that role could be.	0
1301	SANDERS	So, I thank you very much for that.	0
1302	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1303	SANDERS	My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent.	0
1304	SANDERS	Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed.	0
1305	SANDERS	And she turned around many lives.	0
1306	SANDERS	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.	0
1307	SANDERS	She has devoted her life, when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper.	0
1308	SANDERS	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.	0
1309	SANDERS	She led that effort.	0
1310	SANDERS	So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.	0
1311	MUIR	Senator, thank you.	0
1312	O'MALLEY	Well, that would be totally up to her.	0
1313	O'MALLEY	I mean, Katie has never been a person who let her husband's professional choices get in the way of following her dreams.	0
1314	O'MALLEY	And I think she got that from her mother, actually.	0
1315	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1316	O'MALLEY	The -- and I readily admit that she is a far more accomplished lawyer than I was ever able to become, before I took my detour.	0
1317	O'MALLEY	She is a district court judge in Maryland.	0
1318	O'MALLEY	She puts in a full day there.	0
1319	O'MALLEY	We've raised four terrific kids.	0
1320	O'MALLEY	And yet, when she was first lady of the state, not only would she go to work every day and sit there through a lot of sad and gut-wrenching cases, but then she'd put in additional time being an advocate against domestic violence.	0
1321	O'MALLEY	Maryland made great strides on that because of her advocacy, and her understanding of how the court process works.	0
1322	O'MALLEY	She was an advocate against bullying and implementing anti-bullying things.	0
1323	O'MALLEY	So Katie O'Malley will do whatever Katie O'Malley wants to do, regardless of her husband's success in getting elected president.	0
1324	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1325	MUIR	Governor O'Malley, thank you, (inaudible).	0
1326	O'MALLEY	Thank you.	0
1327	MUIR	Governor, thank you.	0
1328	MUIR	We'll be back with much more from New Hampshire.	0
1329	MUIR	The Democratic debate continues right after this.	0
1330	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
1331	MUIR	Welcome back tonight.	0
1332	MUIR	It's been an evening of lively discussion among the candidates and it's time for closing statements.	0
1333	MUIR	We began in alphabetical order, so we'll reverse the order at the end and begin with you, Senator Sanders.	0
1334	SANDERS	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.	0
1335	SANDERS	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.	0
1336	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1337	SANDERS	My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it's like to be the son of an immigrant.	0
1338	SANDERS	We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.	0
1339	SANDERS	My mother's dream -- and she died very young, but my mother's dream for her whole life was to be able to get out of that rent-controlled apartment and own a home of her own.	0
1340	SANDERS	She never lived to see that.	0
1341	SANDERS	But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college.	0
1342	SANDERS	We were the first in the family.	0
1343	SANDERS	So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.	0
1344	SANDERS	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.	0
1345	SANDERS	Thank you very much.	0
1346	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1347	RADDATZ	Governor O'Malley?	0
1348	RADDATZ	Martha, thank you.	0
1349	RADDATZ	I want to thank all of the people who have tuned in tonight.	0
1350	RADDATZ	I want to thank the great people of New Hampshire, where despite all of the cynicism about big money and big banks taking over our politics, here in New Hampshire, the individual matters.	0
1351	RADDATZ	You know, my wife Katie and I have four terrific kids, and like you, there's probably nothing we wouldn't do to give them a future that's safer, that's healthier, where they have more opportunity than our parents and grandparents gave to us.	0
1352	RADDATZ	Tonight, what you listened to was a healthy exchange of ideas about how we'd do that, that which we have always proven, the capacity to do better than any nation in the world, to take actions that include more of our people more fully in the economic, social and political life of our country.	0
1353	RADDATZ	When you listened to the Republican debate the other night, you heard a lot of anger and you had a lot of fear.	0
1354	RADDATZ	Well, they can have their anger and they can have their fear, but anger and fear never built America.	0
1355	RADDATZ	We build our country by adopting wage and labor policies, including comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway of citizenship for all.	0
1356	RADDATZ	We do it by investing in our country, by investing in infrastructure, by investing in the skills and the talents of our people with debt-free college, and we can do it again.	0
1357	RADDATZ	And we also create a better future for our kids when we square our shoulders to the great challenges of our times, whether it's terror trying to undermine our values or Republican presidential candidates trying to get us to surrender our freedoms and our values in the face of this threat.	0
1358	RADDATZ	The other big challenge we have is climate change.	0
1359	RADDATZ	The greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years.	0
1360	RADDATZ	We need to embrace this.	0
1361	RADDATZ	I have put forward a plan that does this, that moves us to 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050.	0
1362	RADDATZ	Join this campaign for the future.	0
1363	RADDATZ	New leadership is what our country needs to move us out of these divided and polarized times.	0
1364	RADDATZ	Thank you.	0
1365	MUIR	Governor, thank you.	0
1366	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1367	MUIR	Secretary Clinton?	0
1368	CLINTON	On January 20th, 2017, the next president of the United States will walk into the White House.	0
1369	CLINTON	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.	0
1370	CLINTON	A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk.	0
1371	CLINTON	Social Security, which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme, may face privatization.	0
1372	CLINTON	Our vets may see the V.A.	0
1373	CLINTON	hospital that needs to be improved and made better for them turned over to privatization.	0
1374	CLINTON	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.	0
1375	CLINTON	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.	0
1376	CLINTON	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.	0
1377	CLINTON	This is a watershed election.	0
1378	CLINTON	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.	0
1379	CLINTON	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.	0
1380	CLINTON	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.	0
1381	CLINTON	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.	0
1382	CLINTON	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.	0
1383	CLINTON	Thank you, good night and may the force be with you.	0
1384	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1385	MUIR	Thank you to the candidates tonight.	0
