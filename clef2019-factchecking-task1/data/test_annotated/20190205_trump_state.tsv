2	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
3	TRUMP	— and my fellow Americans:	0
4	TRUMP	We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential.	0
5	TRUMP	As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.	0
6	TRUMP	Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation.	0
7	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
8	TRUMP	The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda.	0
9	TRUMP	It’s the agenda of the American people.	0
10	TRUMP	"Many of us have campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our nation’s infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern, and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America’s interests first."	0
11	TRUMP	There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage, together, to seize it.	0
12	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
13	TRUMP	Victory is not winning for our party.	0
14	TRUMP	Victory is winning for our country.	0
15	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
16	TRUMP	This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America’s mission and the power of American pride.	0
17	TRUMP	"In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the ""Great Crusade"" — the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II."	0
18	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
19	TRUMP	On D-Day, June 6th, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny.	0
20	TRUMP	Here with us tonight are three of those incredible heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik.	0
21	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
22	TRUMP	Please.	0
23	TRUMP	Gentlemen, we salute you.	0
24	TRUMP	In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon.	0
25	TRUMP	Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin.	0
26	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
27	TRUMP	Thank you, Buzz.	0
28	TRUMP	This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.	0
29	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
30	TRUMP	In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, redefined the middle class, and, when you get down to it, there’s nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with America.	0
31	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
32	TRUMP	Now we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century.	0
33	TRUMP	An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within reach.	0
34	TRUMP	We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.	0
35	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
36	TRUMP	But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.	0
37	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
38	TRUMP	Together, we can break decades of political stalemate.	0
39	TRUMP	We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.	0
40	TRUMP	The decision is ours to make.	0
41	TRUMP	We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.	0
42	TRUMP	Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.	0
43	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
44	TRUMP	Over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.	0
45	TRUMP	In just over two years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom — a boom that has rarely been seen before.	0
46	TRUMP	There’s been nothing like it.	0
47	TRUMP	We have created 5.3 million new jobs and, importantly, added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do.	1
48	TRUMP	But the fact is, we are just getting started.	0
49	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
50	TRUMP	Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue-collar workers, who I promised to fight for.	0
51	TRUMP	They’re growing faster than anyone else thought possible.	0
52	TRUMP	Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.	1
53	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
54	TRUMP	The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office.	0
55	TRUMP	And we are considered, far and away, the hottest economy anywhere in the world.	0
56	TRUMP	Not even close.	0
57	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
58	TRUMP	Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century.	0
59	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
60	TRUMP	African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded.	1
61	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
62	TRUMP	Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low.	0
63	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
64	TRUMP	More people are working now than at any time in the history of our country — 157 million people at work.	1
65	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
66	TRUMP	We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.	0
67	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
68	TRUMP	We virtually ended the estate tax — or death tax, as it is often called — on small businesses for ranchers and also for family farms.	0
69	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
70	TRUMP	We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty.	0
71	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
72	TRUMP	And to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, we passed, very importantly, Right to Try.	0
73	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
74	TRUMP	My administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure.	0
75	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
76	TRUMP	Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations.	0
77	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
78	TRUMP	And we have unleashed a revolution in American energy.	1
79	TRUMP	The United States is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.	1
80	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
81	TRUMP	And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.	1
82	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
83	TRUMP	After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on Earth, by far, and America —	0
84	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
85	TRUMP	— America is again winning each and every day.	0
86	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
87	TRUMP	Members of Congress: The state of our union is strong.	0
88	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
89	AUDIENCE	USA!	0
90	AUDIENCE	USA!	0
91	AUDIENCE	USA!	0
92	TRUMP	That sounds so good.	0
93	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
94	TRUMP	Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.	0
95	TRUMP	On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone — almost double the number expected.	0
96	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
97	TRUMP	An economic miracle is taking place in the United States, and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.	0
98	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
99	TRUMP	If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.	0
100	TRUMP	It just doesn’t work that way.	0
101	TRUMP	We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.	0
102	TRUMP	This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate.	0
103	TRUMP	In some cases, years and years waiting.	0
104	TRUMP	Not right.	0
105	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
106	TRUMP	The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our country.	0
107	TRUMP	Now is the time for bipartisan action.	0
108	TRUMP	Believe it or not, we have already proven that that’s possible.	0
109	TRUMP	In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new farm bill, historic VA reforms.	1
110	TRUMP	And after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so that we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.	1
111	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
112	TRUMP	And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform.	0
113	TRUMP	They said it couldn’t be done.	0
114	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
115	TRUMP	Last year, I heard, through friends, the story of Alice Johnson.	0
116	TRUMP	I was deeply moved.	0
117	TRUMP	In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender.	0
118	TRUMP	Over the next 22 years, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path.	0
119	TRUMP	She had a big impact on that prison population, and far beyond.	0
120	TRUMP	Alice’s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing, and the need to remedy this total injustice.	0
121	TRUMP	She served almost that 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of her life.	0
122	TRUMP	In June, I commuted Alice’s sentence.	0
123	TRUMP	When I saw Alice’s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did something right.	0
124	TRUMP	Alice is with us tonight, and she is a terrific woman.	0
125	TRUMP	Terrific.	0
126	TRUMP	Alice, please.	0
127	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
128	TRUMP	Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.	0
129	TRUMP	Thank you very much, Alice.	0
130	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
131	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
132	TRUMP	Inspired by stories like Alice’s, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the FIRST STEP Act into law.	0
133	TRUMP	Big deal.	0
134	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
135	TRUMP	It’s a big deal.	0
136	TRUMP	This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African American community.	0
137	TRUMP	The FIRST STEP Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.	0
138	TRUMP	Now states across the country are following our lead.	0
139	TRUMP	America is a nation that believes in redemption.	0
140	TRUMP	We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee.	0
141	TRUMP	In 1996, at the age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses.	0
142	TRUMP	Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored many of his fellow inmates.	0
143	TRUMP	Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the FIRST STEP Act.	0
144	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
145	TRUMP	Matthew, please.	0
146	TRUMP	Thank you, Matthew.	0
147	TRUMP	Welcome home.	0
148	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
149	TRUMP	Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.	0
150	TRUMP	Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our very dangerous southern border.	0
151	TRUMP	Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.	0
152	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
153	TRUMP	As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States.	0
154	TRUMP	We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection.	0
155	TRUMP	I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for this tremendous onslaught.	0
156	TRUMP	This is a moral issue.	0
157	TRUMP	The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial wellbeing of all America.	0
158	TRUMP	We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.	0
159	TRUMP	This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today who followed the rules and respected our laws.	0
160	TRUMP	Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.	0
161	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
162	TRUMP	I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.	0
163	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
164	TRUMP	Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.	0
165	TRUMP	No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration.	0
166	TRUMP	Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls, and gates, and guards.	0
167	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
168	TRUMP	Meanwhile, working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration: reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded you can’t get in, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.	0
169	TRUMP	"Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate; it is actually very cruel."	0
170	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
171	TRUMP	One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.	0
172	TRUMP	Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.	0
173	TRUMP	Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide-open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.	1
174	TRUMP	Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.	1
175	TRUMP	The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American states, and they almost all come through our southern border.	0
176	TRUMP	Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City.	0
177	TRUMP	We are removing these gang members by the thousands.	0
178	TRUMP	But until we secure our border, they’re going to keep streaming right back in.	0
179	TRUMP	Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.	1
180	TRUMP	I’ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel moms and dads, and families.	0
181	TRUMP	No one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache that they have had to endure.	0
182	TRUMP	Here tonight is Debra Bissell.	0
183	TRUMP	Just three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada home by an illegal alien.	0
184	TRUMP	They were in their eighties, and are survived by 4 children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren.	0
185	TRUMP	Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon’s granddaughter Heather, and great-granddaughter Madison.	0
186	TRUMP	To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand.	0
187	TRUMP	Few can understand your pain.	0
188	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
189	TRUMP	And thank you for being here.	0
190	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
191	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
192	TRUMP	I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon that it should never happen again.	0
193	TRUMP	Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border.	0
194	TRUMP	In the last two years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings or murders.	0
195	TRUMP	We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.	0
196	TRUMP	When Elvin —	0
197	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
198	TRUMP	— thank you.	0
199	TRUMP	When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.	0
200	TRUMP	At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent.	0
201	TRUMP	Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.	0
202	TRUMP	"Elvin says that, ""If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve [really] done my job."""	0
203	TRUMP	Thanks to his work, and that of his incredible colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the horror of this terrible situation, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars.	0
204	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
205	TRUMP	Thank you, Elvin.	0
206	TRUMP	We will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement, and I pledge to you tonight that I will never abolish our heroes from ICE.	0
207	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
208	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
209	TRUMP	My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on the southern border.	0
210	TRUMP	It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry.	0
211	TRUMP	In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper wall never got built.	0
212	TRUMP	I will get it built.	0
213	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
214	TRUMP	This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall.	0
215	TRUMP	It will be deployed in the areas identified by the border agents as having the greatest need.	0
216	TRUMP	And these agents will tell you: Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down.	1
217	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
218	TRUMP	San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country.	1
219	TRUMP	In response, a strong security wall was put in place.	0
220	TRUMP	This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.	1
221	TRUMP	The border city of El Paso, Texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities.	1
222	TRUMP	Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country.	1
223	TRUMP	Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives.	1
224	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
225	TRUMP	So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.	0
226	TRUMP	As we work to defend our people’s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.	0
227	TRUMP	No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year.	0
228	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
229	TRUMP	You weren’t supposed to do that.	0
230	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
231	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
232	TRUMP	All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before.	1
233	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
234	TRUMP	Don’t sit yet.	0
235	TRUMP	You’re going to like this.	0
236	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
237	TRUMP	And exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.	0

243	TRUMP	Really great.	0
244	TRUMP	And congratulations.	0
245	TRUMP	That’s great.	0
246	TRUMP	As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first-ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.	0
247	TRUMP	To build on —	0
248	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
249	TRUMP	— thank you.	0
250	TRUMP	To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount: reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.	0
251	TRUMP	So bad.	0
252	TRUMP	We are now making it clear to China that, after years of targeting our industries and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.	0
253	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
254	TRUMP	Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, and now our Treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars.	0
255	TRUMP	"But I don’t blame China for taking advantage of us; I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen."	0
256	TRUMP	I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China.	0
257	TRUMP	But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.	0
258	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
259	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
260	TRUMP	Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.	0
261	TRUMP	I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by the signing of NAFTA.	0
262	TRUMP	For years, politicians promised them they would renegotiate for a better deal, but no one ever tried, until now.	0
263	TRUMP	Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA, will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers like they haven’t had delivered to for a long time.	0
264	TRUMP	"I hope you can pass the USMCA into law so that we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expand American agriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are proudly stamped with our four beautiful words: ""Made in the USA."""	0
265	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
266	TRUMP	Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that they sell to us.	0
267	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
268	TRUMP	Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure.	0
269	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
270	TRUMP	I know that Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill, and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting-edge industries of the future.	0
271	TRUMP	This is not an option.	0
272	TRUMP	This is a necessity.	0
273	TRUMP	The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, and to protect patients with preexisting conditions.	0
274	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
275	TRUMP	Already, as a result of my administration’s efforts, in 2018, drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.	0
276	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
277	TRUMP	But we must do more.	0
278	TRUMP	It’s unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place.	0
279	TRUMP	This is wrong, this is unfair, and together we will stop it — and we’ll stop it fast.	0
280	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
281	TRUMP	I am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients, finally.	0
282	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
283	TRUMP	We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down.	0
284	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
285	TRUMP	No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom.	0
286	TRUMP	In recent years —	0
287	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
288	TRUMP	— in recent years, we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS.	0
289	TRUMP	Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach.	0
290	TRUMP	My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.	0
291	TRUMP	We have made incredible strides.	0
292	TRUMP	Incredible.	0
293	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
294	TRUMP	Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond.	0
295	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
296	TRUMP	Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.	0

303	TRUMP	Every birthday since she was four, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital.	0
304	TRUMP	She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself.	0
305	TRUMP	That’s what happened.	0
306	TRUMP	Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer.	0
307	TRUMP	Immediately, she began radiation treatment.	0
308	TRUMP	At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer.	0
309	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
310	TRUMP	"When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered — they loved her; they still love her — with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: ""Last day of chemo."""	0
311	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
312	TRUMP	Thank you very much, Grace.	0
313	TRUMP	You are a great inspiration to everyone in this room.	0
314	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
315	TRUMP	Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades.	0
316	TRUMP	My budget will ask Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical lifesaving research.	0
317	TRUMP	To help support working parents, the time has come to pass School Choice for Americans’ children.	0
318	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
319	TRUMP	I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave, so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.	0
320	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
321	TRUMP	There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days.	0
322	TRUMP	Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments from birth.	1
323	TRUMP	These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world.	0
324	TRUMP	And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth.	0
325	TRUMP	To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb.	0
326	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
327	TRUMP	Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.	0
328	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
329	TRUMP	And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God.	0
330	TRUMP	The final part of my agenda is to protect American security.	0
331	TRUMP	Over the last two years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States military, with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year.	0
332	TRUMP	We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share.	0
333	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
334	TRUMP	Finally.	0
335	TRUMP	Finally.	0
336	TRUMP	For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by friends of ours, members of NATO.	0
337	TRUMP	But now we have secured, over the last couple of years, more than $100 billion of increase in defense spending from our NATO Allies.	0
338	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
339	TRUMP	They said it couldn’t be done.	0
340	TRUMP	As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art missile defense system.	0
341	TRUMP	Under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing America’s interests.	0
342	TRUMP	For example, decades ago, the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capability.	0
343	TRUMP	While we followed the agreement and the rules to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms.	0
344	TRUMP	It’s been going on for many years.	0
345	TRUMP	That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.	0
346	TRUMP	Perhaps —	0
347	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
348	TRUMP	— we really have no choice.	0
349	TRUMP	Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t — in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.	0
350	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
351	TRUMP	As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula.	0
352	TRUMP	Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15 months.	0
353	TRUMP	If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea.	0
354	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
355	TRUMP	Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.	0
356	TRUMP	Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27th and 28th in Vietnam.	0
357	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
358	TRUMP	Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela —	0
359	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
360	TRUMP	— and its new President, Juan Guaidó.	0
361	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
362	TRUMP	We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom, and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.	0
363	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
364	TRUMP	Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country.	0
365	AUDIENCE	Booo —	0
366	TRUMP	America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination, and control.	0
367	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
368	TRUMP	We are born free and we will stay free.	0
369	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
370	AUDIENCE	USA!	0
371	AUDIENCE	USA!	0
372	AUDIENCE	USA!	0
373	TRUMP	Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.	0
374	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
375	AUDIENCE	USA!	0
376	AUDIENCE	USA!	0
377	AUDIENCE	USA!	0
378	TRUMP	One of the most complex set of challenges we face, and have for many years, is in the Middle East.	0
379	TRUMP	Our approach is based on principled realism, not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress.	0
380	TRUMP	For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of Israel, and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.	0
381	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
382	TRUMP	Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years.	0
383	TRUMP	In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives.	0
384	TRUMP	More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded.	0
385	TRUMP	We have spent more than $7 trillion in fighting wars in the Middle East.	0
386	TRUMP	As a candidate for President, I loudly pledged a new approach.	0
387	TRUMP	Great nations do not fight endless wars.	0
388	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
389	TRUMP	When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria — just two years ago.	1
390	TRUMP	Today, we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters.	1
391	TRUMP	Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.	0
392	TRUMP	I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach — if possible — a political settlement in Afghanistan.	0
393	TRUMP	The opposing side is also very happy to be negotiating.	0
394	TRUMP	Our troops have fought with unmatched valor.	0
395	TRUMP	And thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this long and bloody conflict.	0
396	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
397	TRUMP	In Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban.	0
398	TRUMP	As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop’s presence and focus on counterterrorism.	0
399	TRUMP	And we will indeed focus on counterterrorism.	0
400	TRUMP	We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement, but we do know that, after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.	0
401	TRUMP	And the other side would like to do the same thing.	0
402	TRUMP	It’s time.	0
403	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
404	TRUMP	Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation’s power and will to defend our people.	0
405	TRUMP	Eighteen years ago, violent terrorists attacked the USS Cole.	0
406	TRUMP	And last month, American forces killed one of the leaders of that attack.	0
407	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
408	TRUMP	We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost.	0
409	TRUMP	Tom, we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.	0
410	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
411	TRUMP	Thank you, Tom.	0
412	TRUMP	My administration has acted decisively to confront the world’s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.	0
413	TRUMP	It is a radical regime.	0
414	TRUMP	They do bad, bad things.	0
415	TRUMP	To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.	0
416	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
417	TRUMP	And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by us on a country.	0
418	TRUMP	"We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants ""Death to America"" and threatens genocide against the Jewish people."	0
419	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
420	TRUMP	We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed.	0
421	TRUMP	With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.	0
422	TRUMP	Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.	0
423	TRUMP	SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer.	0
424	TRUMP	And he was very successful.	0
425	TRUMP	Timothy has just had his 12th surgery, and he is going in for many more.	0
426	TRUMP	But he made the trip to be here with us tonight.	0
427	TRUMP	Officer Matson, please.	0
428	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
429	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
430	TRUMP	We are forever grateful.	0
431	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
432	TRUMP	Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor, Judah Samet.	0
433	TRUMP	He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began.	0
434	TRUMP	But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall, more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps.	0
435	TRUMP	Today is Judah’s 81st birthday.	0
436	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
437	AUDIENCE	"(Sings ""Happy Birthday."")"	0
438	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
439	SAMET	Thank you!	0
440	TRUMP	They wouldn’t do that for me, Judah.	0
441	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
442	TRUMP	Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train and told they were going to another camp.	0
443	TRUMP	Suddenly, the train screeched to a very strong halt.	0
444	TRUMP	A soldier appeared.	0
445	TRUMP	Judah’s family braced for the absolute worst.	0
446	TRUMP	"Then, his father cried out with joy, ""It’s the Americans! It’s the Americans!"""	0
447	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
448	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
449	TRUMP	A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau.	0
450	TRUMP	He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks.	0
451	TRUMP	"To me, Joshua recalls, ""the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky."""	0
452	TRUMP	They came down from Heaven.	0
453	TRUMP	I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War.	0
454	TRUMP	One of them was Herman Zeitchik.	0
455	TRUMP	But there is more to Herman’s story.	0
456	TRUMP	A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of the American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau.	0
457	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
458	TRUMP	He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth.	0
459	TRUMP	Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight, seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom.	0
460	TRUMP	Herman and Joshua, your presence this evening is very much appreciated.	0
461	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
462	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
463	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
464	TRUMP	When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.	0
465	TRUMP	They did not know if they would survive the hour.	0
466	TRUMP	They did not know if they would grow old.	0
467	TRUMP	But they knew that America had to prevail.	0
468	TRUMP	Their cause was this nation and generations yet unborn.	0
469	TRUMP	Why did they do it?	0
470	TRUMP	They did it for America.	0
471	TRUMP	They did it for us.	0
472	TRUMP	Everything that has come since — our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice — all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.	0
473	TRUMP	Think of this Capitol.	0
474	TRUMP	Think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, and defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, and to face down evil empires.	0
475	TRUMP	Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic.	0
476	TRUMP	"You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California."	0
477	TRUMP	Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history.	0
478	TRUMP	What will we do with this moment?	0
479	TRUMP	How will we be remembered?	0
480	TRUMP	I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us.	0
481	TRUMP	Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.	0
482	TRUMP	Our most exciting journeys still await.	0
483	TRUMP	Our biggest victories are still to come.	0
484	TRUMP	We have not yet begun to dream.	0
485	TRUMP	We must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether we dare to transcend them.	0
486	TRUMP	We must choose whether we squander our great inheritance or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans.	0
487	TRUMP	We do the incredible.	0
488	TRUMP	We defy the impossible.	0
489	TRUMP	We conquer the unknown.	0
490	TRUMP	This is the time to reignite the American imagination.	0
491	TRUMP	This is the time to search for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star.	0
492	TRUMP	This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.	0
493	TRUMP	This is our future, our fate, and our choice to make.	0
494	TRUMP	I am asking you to choose greatness.	0
495	TRUMP	No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.	0
496	TRUMP	We must keep America first in our hearts.	0
497	TRUMP	We must keep freedom alive in our souls.	0
498	TRUMP	And we must always keep faith in America’s destiny that one nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise, and the light and the glory, among all the nations of the world.	0
499	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
500	TRUMP	God bless you.	0
501	TRUMP	And God bless America.	0
502	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
