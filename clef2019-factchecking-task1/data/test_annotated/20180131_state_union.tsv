1	TRUMP	Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:	0
2	TRUMP	Less than one year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American people and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams.	0
3	TRUMP	That night, our new administration had already taken very swift action.	0
4	TRUMP	A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land.	0
5	TRUMP	Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission — to make America great again for all Americans.	0
6	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
7	TRUMP	Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success.	0
8	TRUMP	We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined.	0
9	TRUMP	We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship.	0
10	TRUMP	We have endured floods and fires and storms.	0
11	TRUMP	But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America’s soul, and the steel in America’s spine.	0
12	TRUMP	Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be.	0
13	TRUMP	We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy, racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane.	0
14	TRUMP	We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.	0
15	TRUMP	We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania.	0
16	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
17	TRUMP	Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the Hurricane Harvey.	0
18	TRUMP	Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water to help save more than 40 lives.	0
19	TRUMP	Ashlee, we all thank you.	0
20	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
21	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
22	TRUMP	We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg.	0
23	TRUMP	He’s here with us also.	0
24	TRUMP	David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by those devastating wildfires.	0
25	TRUMP	To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands — everywhere — we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always.	0
26	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
27	TRUMP	Thank you to David and the brave people of California.	0
28	TRUMP	Thank you very much, David.	0
29	TRUMP	Great job.	0
30	TRUMP	Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally.	0
31	TRUMP	With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House — a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later: the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise.	0
32	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
33	TRUMP	I think they like you, Steve.	0
34	TRUMP	(LAUGHTER)	0
35	TRUMP	"We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others; some in this room."	0
36	TRUMP	In the aftermath —	0
37	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
38	TRUMP	— yes.	0
39	TRUMP	Yes.	0
40	TRUMP	In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people.	0
41	TRUMP	But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy.	0
42	TRUMP	Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people.	0
43	TRUMP	This is really the key.	0
44	TRUMP	These are the people we were elected to serve.	0
45	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
46	TRUMP	Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans.	0
47	TRUMP	If there is a mountain, we climb it.	0
48	TRUMP	If there is a frontier, we cross it.	0
49	TRUMP	If there’s a challenge, we tame it.	0
50	TRUMP	If there’s an opportunity, we seize it.	0
51	TRUMP	So let’s begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong.	0
52	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
53	TRUMP	And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.	0
54	TRUMP	Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including —	1
55	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
56	TRUMP	— including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone.	1
57	TRUMP	Tremendous numbers.	0
58	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
59	TRUMP	After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.	0
60	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
61	TRUMP	Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low.	0
62	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
63	TRUMP	It’s something I’m very proud of.	0
64	TRUMP	African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded.	1
65	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
66	TRUMP	And Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.	1
67	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
68	TRUMP	Small-business confidence is at an all-time high.	0
69	TRUMP	The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion, and more, in value in just this short period of time.	0
70	TRUMP	The great news —	0
71	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
72	TRUMP	— the great news for Americans’ 401(k), retirement, pension, and college savings accounts have gone through the roof.	0
73	TRUMP	And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.	1
74	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
75	TRUMP	Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business.	1
76	TRUMP	To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone.	1
77	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
78	TRUMP	Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free.	1
79	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
80	TRUMP	We also doubled the child tax credit.	1
81	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
82	TRUMP	A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000, slashing their tax bill in half.	1
83	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
84	TRUMP	In April, this will be the last time you will ever file under the old and very broken system, and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month — a lot more.	0
85	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
86	TRUMP	We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they couldn’t afford government-ordered health plans.	1
87	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
88	TRUMP	We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare.	0
89	TRUMP	The individual mandate is now gone.	0
90	TRUMP	Thank heaven.	0
91	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
92	TRUMP	We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world.	1
93	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
94	TRUMP	These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000.	1
95	TRUMP	A lot of money.	0
96	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
97	TRUMP	Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.	1
98	TRUMP	Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing, a small, beautiful business in Ohio.	0
99	TRUMP	They’ve just finished the best year in their 20-year history.	0
100	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
101	TRUMP	Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door.	0
102	TRUMP	Good feeling.	0
103	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
104	TRUMP	One of Staub’s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight.	0
105	TRUMP	Corey is an all-American worker.	0
106	TRUMP	He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder.	0
107	TRUMP	Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax cut raise into his new home and his two daughters’ education.	0
108	TRUMP	Corey, please stand.	0
109	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
110	TRUMP	And he’s a great welder.	0
111	TRUMP	(LAUGHTER)	0
112	TRUMP	I was told that by the man that owns that company that’s doing so well.	0
113	TRUMP	So congratulations, Corey.	0
114	TRUMP	Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker.	1
115	TRUMP	And it’s getting more every month, every week.	0
116	TRUMP	Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers.	0
117	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
118	TRUMP	And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a $50 billion investment in the United States, just a little while ago.	0
119	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
120	TRUMP	This, in fact, is our new American moment.	0
121	TRUMP	There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.	0
122	TRUMP	So to every citizen watching at home tonight, no matter where you’ve been, or where you’ve come from, this is your time.	0
123	TRUMP	If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve absolutely anything.	0
124	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
125	TRUMP	Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of a nation we are going to be.	0
126	TRUMP	All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family can do anything.	0
127	TRUMP	We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag.	0
128	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
129	TRUMP	Together, we are rediscovering the American way.	0
130	TRUMP	In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life.	0
131	TRUMP	"The motto is, ""In God We Trust."""	0
132	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
133	TRUMP	And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.	0
134	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
135	TRUMP	Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans’ graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day.	0
136	TRUMP	He decided all by himself to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes.	0
137	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
138	TRUMP	Preston, a job well done.	0
139	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
140	TRUMP	Young patriots, like Preston, teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans.	0
141	TRUMP	And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something very special — that I can tell you.	0
142	TRUMP	Great future.	0
143	TRUMP	Thank you very much for all you’ve done, Preston.	0
144	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
145	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
146	TRUMP	Preston’s reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us of why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the National Anthem.	0
147	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
148	TRUMP	Americans love their country, and they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.	0
149	TRUMP	For the last year, we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their government.	0
150	TRUMP	Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country.	1
151	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
152	TRUMP	We are totally defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty.	0
153	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
154	TRUMP	And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions.	0
155	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
156	TRUMP	Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act.	0
157	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
158	TRUMP	Since its passage, my administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve.	0
159	TRUMP	And we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do.	0
160	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
161	TRUMP	And I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.	0
162	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
163	TRUMP	All Americans deserve accountability and respect, and that’s what we are giving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans.	0
164	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
165	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
166	TRUMP	So, tonight, I call on Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers and to remove federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people.	0
167	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
168	TRUMP	In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our country.	0
169	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
170	TRUMP	We have ended the war on American energy, and we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal.	0
171	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
172	TRUMP	We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world.	1
173	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
174	TRUMP	In Detroit, I halted government mandates that crippled America’s great, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get Motor City revving its engines again.	0
175	TRUMP	And that’s what’s happening.	0
176	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
177	TRUMP	Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States — something we haven’t seen for decades.	1
178	TRUMP	Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan.	1
179	TRUMP	Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama — a big one.	1
180	TRUMP	And we haven’t seen this in a long time.	1
181	TRUMP	It’s all coming back.	0
182	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
183	TRUMP	Very soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our country.	0
184	TRUMP	This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing.	0
185	TRUMP	For many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us.	0
186	TRUMP	But now they are roaring back.	0
187	TRUMP	They’re coming back.	0
188	TRUMP	They want to be where the action is.	0
189	TRUMP	They want to be in the United States of America.	0
190	TRUMP	That’s where they want to be.	0
191	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
192	TRUMP	Exciting progress is happening every single day.	0
193	TRUMP	To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our country’s history.	0
194	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
195	TRUMP	We also believe that patients with terminal conditions, and terminal illness, should have access to experimental treatment immediately that could potentially save their lives.	0
196	TRUMP	People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure.	0
197	TRUMP	I want to give them a chance right here at home.	0
198	TRUMP	It’s time for Congress to give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try.	0
199	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
200	TRUMP	One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.	0
201	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
202	TRUMP	In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States.	0
203	TRUMP	And it’s very, very unfair.	0
204	TRUMP	That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for the year.	0
205	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
206	TRUMP	And prices will come down substantially.	0
207	TRUMP	Watch.	0
208	TRUMP	America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our wealth.	1
209	TRUMP	Our nation has lost its wealth, but we’re getting it back so fast.	1
210	TRUMP	The era of economic surrender is totally over.	1
211	TRUMP	From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and, very importantly, reciprocal.	0
212	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
213	TRUMP	We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones.	0
214	TRUMP	And they’ll be good ones, but they’ll be fair.	0
215	TRUMP	And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade rules.	0
216	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
217	TRUMP	As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.	0
218	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
219	TRUMP	America is a nation of builders.	0
220	TRUMP	We built the Empire State Building in just one year.	0
221	TRUMP	Isn’t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road?	0
222	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
223	TRUMP	I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve.	0
224	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
225	TRUMP	Tonight, I’m calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs.	0
226	TRUMP	Every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit.	0
227	TRUMP	And we can do it.	0
228	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
229	TRUMP	Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process, getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one.	0
230	TRUMP	Together, we can reclaim our great building heritage.	0
231	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
232	TRUMP	We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land.	0
233	TRUMP	And we will do it with American heart, and American hands, and American grit.	0
234	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
235	TRUMP	We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day’s work.	0
236	TRUMP	We want every child to be safe in their home at night.	0
237	TRUMP	And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we all love so much.	0
238	TRUMP	We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.	0
239	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
240	TRUMP	As tax cuts create new jobs, let’s invest in workforce development and let’s invest in job training, which we need so badly.	0
241	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
242	TRUMP	Let’s open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential.	0
243	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
244	TRUMP	And let’s support working families by supporting paid family leave.	0
245	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
246	TRUMP	As America regains its strength, opportunity must be extended to all citizens.	0
247	TRUMP	That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance at life.	0
248	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
249	TRUMP	Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families.	0
250	TRUMP	For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities.	0
251	TRUMP	They’ve allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans.	0
252	TRUMP	Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.	0
253	TRUMP	Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens.	0
254	TRUMP	Their two teenage daughters — Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens — were close friends on Long Island.	0
255	TRUMP	But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa’s 16th Birthday — such a happy time it should have been — neither of them came home.	0
256	TRUMP	These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown.	0
257	TRUMP	Six members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and Nisa’s murders.	0
258	TRUMP	Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied alien minors, and wound up in Kayla and Nisa’s high school.	0
259	TRUMP	Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you.	0
260	TRUMP	Everyone in America is grieving for you.	0
261	TRUMP	Please stand.	0
262	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
263	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
264	TRUMP	I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you.	0
265	TRUMP	We love you.	0
266	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
267	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
268	TRUMP	While we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make sure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain.	0
269	TRUMP	Tonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our country.	0
270	TRUMP	"We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents — these are great people; these are great, great people — that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this can never happen again."	0
271	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
272	TRUMP	The United States is a compassionate nation.	0
273	TRUMP	We are proud that we do more than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world.	1
274	TRUMP	But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant concern is for America’s children, America’s struggling workers, and America’s forgotten communities.	0
275	TRUMP	I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things.	0
276	TRUMP	I want our poor to have their chance to rise.	0
277	TRUMP	So, tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed.	0
278	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
279	TRUMP	My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream.	0
280	TRUMP	Because Americans are dreamers too.	0
281	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
282	TRUMP	Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez.	0
283	TRUMP	"He goes by ""DJ"" and ""CJ."""	0
284	TRUMP	"He said, ""Call me either one."""	0
285	TRUMP	"So we’ll call you ""CJ."""	0
286	TRUMP	Served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our streets.	0
287	TRUMP	Tough job.	0
288	TRUMP	At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ’s murder.	0
289	TRUMP	And they wanted it to happen quickly.	0
290	TRUMP	But he did not cave to threats or to fear.	0
291	TRUMP	Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island.	0
292	TRUMP	His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 MS-13 gang members.	0
293	TRUMP	And I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done — we have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons.	0
294	TRUMP	So I just want to congratulate you, CJ.	0
295	TRUMP	You’re a brave guy.	0
296	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
297	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
298	TRUMP	"And I asked CJ, ""What’s the secret?"""	0
299	TRUMP	"He said, ""We’re just tougher than they are."""	0
300	TRUMP	And I like that answer.	0
301	TRUMP	(LAUGHTER)	0
302	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
303	TRUMP	"Now let’s get Congress to send you — and all of the people in this great chamber have to do it; we have no choice."	0
304	TRUMP	CJ, we’re going to send you reinforcements, and we’re going to send them to you quickly.	0
305	TRUMP	It’s what you need.	0

307	TRUMP	Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package.	0
308	TRUMP	In recent months, my administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform.	0
309	TRUMP	Based on these discussions, we presented Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have.	0
310	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
311	TRUMP	Here are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age.	0
312	TRUMP	That covers almost three times more people than the previous administration covered.	0
313	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
314	TRUMP	Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States over a 12-year period.	0
315	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
316	TRUMP	The second pillar fully secures the border.	0
317	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
318	TRUMP	That means building a great wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like CJ, to keep our communities safe.	0
319	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
320	TRUMP	Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country, and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch and release.	0
321	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
322	TRUMP	The third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people.	1
323	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
324	TRUMP	It’s time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.	0
325	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
326	TRUMP	The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration.	0
327	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
328	TRUMP	Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.	0
329	TRUMP	Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children.	0
330	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
331	TRUMP	This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security and for the future of America.	0
332	TRUMP	In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration.	0
333	TRUMP	In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can just no longer afford.	0
334	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
335	TRUMP	It’s time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century.	0
336	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
337	TRUMP	These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system.	0
338	TRUMP	For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem.	0
339	TRUMP	This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.	0
340	TRUMP	Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first.	0
341	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
342	TRUMP	So let’s come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.	0
343	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
344	TRUMP	These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.	0
345	TRUMP	Never before has it been like it is now.	0
346	TRUMP	It is terrible.	0
347	TRUMP	We have to do something about it.	0
348	TRUMP	"In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses — 174 deaths per day; 7 per hour."	0
349	TRUMP	We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.	0
350	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
351	TRUMP	My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt.	0
352	TRUMP	The struggle will be long and it will be difficult, but as Americans always do — in the end, we will succeed.	0
353	TRUMP	We will prevail.	0
354	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
355	TRUMP	As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America.	0
356	TRUMP	We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico.	0
357	TRUMP	Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department.	0
358	TRUMP	He’s here tonight with his wife Rebecca.	0
359	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
360	TRUMP	Thank you, Ryan.	0
361	TRUMP	Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin.	0
362	TRUMP	When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep.	0
363	TRUMP	She told him she didn’t know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.	0
364	TRUMP	"In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: ""You will do it, because you can."""	0
365	TRUMP	He heard those words.	0
366	TRUMP	He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids.	0
367	TRUMP	Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca.	0
368	TRUMP	In an instant, she agreed to adopt.	0
369	TRUMP	The Holets named their new daughter Hope.	0
370	TRUMP	Ryan and Rebecca, you embody the goodness of our nation.	0
371	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
372	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
373	TRUMP	Thank you, Ryan and Rebecca.	0
374	TRUMP	As we rebuild America’s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.	1
375	TRUMP	Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values.	0
376	TRUMP	In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense.	0
377	TRUMP	For this reason, I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military.	0
378	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
379	TRUMP	As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else.	0
380	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
381	TRUMP	Perhaps someday in the future, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons.	0
382	TRUMP	Unfortunately, we are not there yet, sadly.	0
383	TRUMP	Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth.	0
384	TRUMP	One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other locations, as well.	0
385	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
386	TRUMP	But there is much more work to be done.	0
387	TRUMP	We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.	0
388	TRUMP	Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight.	0
389	TRUMP	Near Raqqa, last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosive so that civilians could return to that city hopefully soon, and hopefully safely.	0
390	TRUMP	Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion.	0
391	TRUMP	Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found Kenton, but in very, very bad shape.	0
392	TRUMP	He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway.	0
393	TRUMP	He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport, and maintained artificial respiration through two and a half hours and through emergency surgery.	0
394	TRUMP	Kenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin’s selfless love for his fellow warrior.	0
395	TRUMP	Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas.	0
396	TRUMP	Raqqa is liberated.	0
397	TRUMP	"And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a ""V"" for ""valor."""	0
398	TRUMP	Staff Sergeant Peck, all of America salutes you.	0
399	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
400	TRUMP	Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil.	0
401	TRUMP	When possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them.	0
402	TRUMP	When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them.	0
403	TRUMP	But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals.	0
404	TRUMP	They are unlawful enemy combatants.	0
405	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
406	TRUMP	And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.	0
407	TRUMP	In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield — including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released.	0
408	TRUMP	So today, I’m keeping another promise.	0
409	TRUMP	I just signed, prior to walking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis, who is doing a great job, thank you —	0
410	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
411	TRUMP	— to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay.	0
412	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
413	TRUMP	I am asking Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we find them.	0
414	TRUMP	And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay.	0
415	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
416	TRUMP	At the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have new rules of engagement.	0
417	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
418	TRUMP	Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.	0
419	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
420	TRUMP	Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the U.S.	0
421	TRUMP	Senate just months before.	0
422	TRUMP	I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.	0
423	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
424	TRUMP	Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America’s sovereign right to make this decision.	0
425	TRUMP	In 2016, American taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20 billion in aid.	0
426	TRUMP	That is why, tonight, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America.	0
427	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
428	TRUMP	As we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries.	0
429	TRUMP	When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent.	0
430	TRUMP	America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.	0
431	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
432	TRUMP	I am asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.	0
433	TRUMP	My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.	0
434	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
435	TRUMP	But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.	0
436	TRUMP	North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.	0
437	TRUMP	We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening.	0
438	TRUMP	Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation.	0
439	TRUMP	I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position.	0
440	TRUMP	We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies.	0
441	TRUMP	Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia — and a great student he was.	0
442	TRUMP	On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea.	0
443	TRUMP	At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state.	0
444	TRUMP	After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death.	0
445	TRUMP	He passed away just days after his return.	0
446	TRUMP	Otto’s wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us tonight, along with Otto’s brother and sister, Austin and Greta.	0
447	TRUMP	Please.	0
448	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
449	TRUMP	Incredible people.	0
450	TRUMP	You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength truly inspires us all.	0
451	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
452	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
453	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
454	TRUMP	Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto’s memory with total American resolve.	0
455	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
456	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
457	TRUMP	Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime.	0
458	TRUMP	His name is Mr.	0
459	TRUMP	Ji Seong-ho.	0
460	TRUMP	In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea.	0
461	TRUMP	One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get.	0
462	TRUMP	In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger.	0
463	TRUMP	He woke up as a train ran over his limbs.	0
464	TRUMP	He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt.	0
465	TRUMP	His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves, permanently stunting their own growth.	0
466	TRUMP	Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China.	0
467	TRUMP	His tormentors wanted to know if he’d met any Christians.	0
468	TRUMP	He had — and he resolved, after that, to be free.	0
469	TRUMP	Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to freedom.	0
470	TRUMP	Most of his family followed.	0
471	TRUMP	His father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death.	0
472	TRUMP	Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth.	0
473	TRUMP	Today, he has a new leg.	0
474	TRUMP	But, Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you’ve come.	0
475	TRUMP	Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.	0
476	TRUMP	Please.	0
477	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
478	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
479	TRUMP	Seong-ho’s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.	0
480	TRUMP	It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America.	0
481	TRUMP	It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness.	0
482	TRUMP	"It was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves; that they could chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the entire world."	0
483	TRUMP	That is what our country has always been about.	0
484	TRUMP	That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done.	0
485	TRUMP	Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom.	0
486	TRUMP	She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought, and lived, and died to protect her.	0
487	TRUMP	Monuments to Washington, and Jefferson, and Lincoln, and King.	0
488	TRUMP	"Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond; and others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all over Asia."	0
489	TRUMP	And freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one.	0
490	TRUMP	This Capitol — this living monument — this is the moment to the American people.	0
491	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
492	AUDIENCE	USA!	0
493	AUDIENCE	USA!	0
494	AUDIENCE	USA!	0
495	TRUMP	We’re a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us, defending hope, pride, and defending the American way.	0
496	TRUMP	They work in every trade.	0
497	TRUMP	They sacrifice to raise a family.	0
498	TRUMP	They care for our children at home.	0
499	TRUMP	They defend our flag abroad.	0
500	TRUMP	And they are strong moms and brave kids.	0
501	TRUMP	They are firefighters, and police officers, and border agents, medics, and Marines.	0
502	TRUMP	But above all else, they are Americans.	0
503	TRUMP	And this Capitol, this city, this nation, belongs entirely to them.	0
504	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
505	TRUMP	Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.	0
506	TRUMP	Americans fill the world with art and music.	0
507	TRUMP	They push the bounds of science and discovery.	0
508	TRUMP	And they forever remind us of what we should never, ever forget: The people dreamed this country.	0
509	TRUMP	The people built this country.	0
510	TRUMP	And it’s the people who are making America great again.	0
511	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
512	TRUMP	As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve.	0
513	TRUMP	As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail.	0
514	TRUMP	Our families will thrive.	0
515	TRUMP	Our people will prosper.	0
516	TRUMP	And our nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.	0
