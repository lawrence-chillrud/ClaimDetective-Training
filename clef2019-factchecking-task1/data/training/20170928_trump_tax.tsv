1	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
2	TRUMP	You just want massive tax cuts.	0
3	TRUMP	That’s what you want.	0
4	TRUMP	That’s the only reason you’re going so wild.	0
5	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
6	TRUMP	But it’s wonderful to be back in the great state of Indiana.	0
7	TRUMP	What a place.	0
8	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
9	TRUMP	I want to thank Senator Todd Young, Senator Joe Donnelly, Representative Jackie Walorski, Representative Susan Brooks, and Representative Mike [sic] Messer for joining us today.	0
10	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
11	TRUMP	Thank you very much for being here.	0
12	TRUMP	Appreciate it.	0
13	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
14	TRUMP	I also want to thank members of my economic team, Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Director Gary Cohn, for joining us, as well.	0
15	TRUMP	We appreciate it.	0
16	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
17	TRUMP	Let me begin by saying that our hearts and prayers go out to the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands who are suffering in the wake of yet another catastrophic hurricane.	0
18	TRUMP	I mean, their island was virtually destroyed.	0
19	TRUMP	Federal agencies are working closely with local partners to help these communities get back on their feet as soon as possible.	0
20	TRUMP	Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are doing great, and the recovery process is happening very, very quickly.	0
21	TRUMP	I will be going down to Puerto Rico next week to get an on-the-ground briefing about the disaster recovery and to see all of our great first responders and to meet a lot of the people who were so affected by these storms.	0
22	TRUMP	We are with you now, I tell them, and we will be there every step of the way until this job is done.	0
23	TRUMP	It is truly catastrophic what happened in Puerto Rico.	0
24	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
25	TRUMP	And massive amounts of water, food, and supplies, by the way, are being delivered on an hourly basis.	0
26	TRUMP	It’s something that nobody has ever seen before from this country, I can tell you that.	0
27	TRUMP	And I’m very proud of all of the folks that have worked so hard in FEMA, all of our first responders, all of our police that have gone to the island because their police force has been so badly affected.	0
28	TRUMP	And many of their policemen — in fact, most of the police people have lost their homes, and it’s been a tough go.	0
29	TRUMP	But we are — we’re going to get it back.	0
30	TRUMP	Before we go on to discuss the largest tax cut in our county’s history, I also want to provide a brief update on healthcare.	0
31	TRUMP	We have the votes on Graham-Cassidy.	1
32	TRUMP	But with the rules of reconciliation, we’re up against a deadline of Friday — two days.	0
33	TRUMP	That’s just two days.	0
34	TRUMP	And yes-vote senator — we have a wonderful senator, great, great senator — who is a yes vote, but he’s home recovering from a pretty tough situation.	0
35	TRUMP	And with so many great features, including all of the block granting, the money to the states, et cetera, et cetera, our healthcare plan is really going to be something excellent.	0
36	TRUMP	It’s going to be better managed for the people that it serves.	0
37	TRUMP	Having local healthcare representatives is far better than having healthcare managed from Washington, D.C.	0
38	TRUMP	Not even a contest.	0
39	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
40	TRUMP	And many, many governors, as you also see, have agreed with us and approved it and really look forward to running it properly.	0
41	TRUMP	But again, because the reconciliation window is about to close, we have to wait a few months until it reopens before we take a vote.	0
42	TRUMP	So we’re getting all of the good signs from Alaska and the others to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
43	TRUMP	And I was hoping this would be put on my desk right after we won the election, and I’d come in and sign.	0
44	TRUMP	But it didn’t work that way.	0
45	TRUMP	There were a couple of people that — I won’t say anything.	0
46	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
47	TRUMP	But early next year when reconciliation kicks back in, in any event long before the November election, we’re going to have a vote.	0
48	TRUMP	And we’re going to be able to get that through, and I think we’ll actually get it through very easily and the time makes it easier.	0
49	TRUMP	But speaking of reconciliation, the Republican Senate needs to get rid of the filibuster rule, which is blocking so many great legislative reforms the American people badly want and deserve.	0
50	TRUMP	By the way, the Democrats, if they had the opportunity, which hopefully they won’t for many, many years, they would get rid of it on day one.	0
51	TRUMP	And most of you know exactly what I’m talking about.	0
52	TRUMP	We’re here today in Indiana to announce our framework to deliver historic tax relief to the American People.	0
53	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
54	TRUMP	This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I guess it’s probably something I can say that I’m very good at.	0
55	TRUMP	I’ve been waiting for this for a long time.	0
56	TRUMP	We’re going to cut taxes for the middle class, make the tax code simpler and more fair for everyday Americans, and we are going to bring back the jobs and wealth that have left our country — and most people thought left our country for good.	0
57	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
58	TRUMP	We want tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and, yes, tax reform that is pro-American.	0
59	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
60	TRUMP	It’s time to take care of our people, to rebuild our nation, and to fight for our great American workers.	0
61	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
62	TRUMP	Indiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes and set free the dreams of our citizens.	0
63	TRUMP	This state has claimed a powerful competitive edge built on low taxes and less regulation — and are we cutting regulation?	0
64	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
65	TRUMP	And businesses all across the country have taken notice.	0
66	TRUMP	In recent years, Indiana has welcomed dozens of companies fleeing high taxes and high-tax states.	1
67	TRUMP	Thousands of new jobs and massive capital investment have followed — meaning a better quality of life for the people of Indiana.	1
68	TRUMP	All of this is possible because the people of this state have made a decision. They chose to make Indiana competitive again.	0
69	TRUMP	They chose, and their choice was so important.	0
70	TRUMP	It included electing a governor, who you may have heard of	0
71	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
72	TRUMP	— who signed the largest income tax cut in the state’s history, our very, very terrific person and terrific Vice President, Mike Pence.	0
73	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
74	TRUMP	It’s time for Washington to learn from the wisdom of Indiana.	0
75	TRUMP	We need Washington to promote American jobs instead of obstructing them.	0
76	TRUMP	That is what I have been working to achieve every day since I took office.	0
77	TRUMP	That is what I talked about on the campaign trail.	0
78	TRUMP	Already, we’re seeing the results of an economic policy that finally puts America first.	0
79	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
80	TRUMP	Unemployment is at a 16-year low.	1
81	TRUMP	Unemployment for African Americans is near its lowest point since the turn of the millennium.	1
82	TRUMP	It’s really a fantastic thing to see.	0
83	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
84	TRUMP	Wages are rising.	1
85	TRUMP	Optimism among manufacturers has reached all-time highs.	0
86	TRUMP	GDP growth last quarter reached 3 percent way ahead of schedule; nobody thought that was going to happen for a long time.	1
87	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
88	TRUMP	And this quarter, I believe, would have been better, but the hurricanes will have an impact.	0
89	TRUMP	But other than that, it would have been, in my opinion, even better.	0
90	TRUMP	Your government is working for you once again, not for the donors, not the special interests, but the hardworking taxpaying citizens of our country.	0
91	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
92	TRUMP	America is back on the right track.	0
93	TRUMP	And I see so many red hats — Make America Great Again.	0
94	TRUMP	That’s what we’re doing — Make America Great Again.	0
95	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
96	TRUMP	But our country and our economy cannot take off like they should unless we dramatically reform America’s outdated, complex, and extremely burdensome tax code.	0
97	TRUMP	It’s a relic.	0
98	TRUMP	We’ve got to change it.	0
99	TRUMP	We have to compete — compete with other countries.	0
100	TRUMP	The current tax system is a colossal barrier standing in the way of America’s economic comeback because it can be far greater than it’s ever been.	0
101	TRUMP	But we’re going to remove that barrier to create the tax system our people finally, finally, finally — and want and deserve.	0
102	TRUMP	For several months, my administration has been working closely with Congress to develop a framework for tax reform.	0
103	TRUMP	Over the next few months, the House and Senate will build on this framework and produce legislation that will deliver more jobs, higher pay, and lower taxes for middle-class families — for the working man and woman — and for businesses of all sizes.	0
104	TRUMP	I look forward	0
105	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
106	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
107	TRUMP	I look forward to working with Congress to deliver these historic tax cuts and reforms to the American people.	0
108	TRUMP	These tax cuts are significant.	0
109	TRUMP	There’s never been tax cuts like what we’re talking about.	0
110	TRUMP	Our framework is based on four key ideas:	0
111	TRUMP	First, we will cut taxes for the everyday, hardworking Americans — the people that work so long, so hard, and they’ve been forgotten.	0
112	TRUMP	But they’re not forgotten anymore.	0
113	TRUMP	I think we proved that on November 8th.	0
114	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
115	TRUMP	Under this framework, the first $12,000 of income earned by a single individual will be tax free,	0
116	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
117	TRUMP	- and a married couple won’t pay a dime in taxes on their first $24,000 of income.	0
118	TRUMP	So, a married couple — up to $24,000 — can spend their money on their family, on their children, on what they have to do.	0
119	TRUMP	So much better.	0
120	TRUMP	In other words, more income for more people will be taxed at a rate of zero.	0
121	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
122	TRUMP	At this zero percent rate, taxable income will be subject to just three tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent.	0
123	TRUMP	Jonathan Blanton and his wife Jamie from Greentown are here with us today.	0
124	TRUMP	Where are they?	0
125	TRUMP	Oh, hello, Jonathan.	0
126	TRUMP	How are you?	0
127	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
128	TRUMP	Jonathan does industrial janitorial work and Jamie works at an auto company.	0
129	TRUMP	Together they’re raising four beautiful children, and last year they earned less than $90,000.	0
130	TRUMP	Under our tax plan they would have saved more than $1,000, and it could be substantially more.	0
131	TRUMP	And that’s just on federal taxes.	0
132	TRUMP	So they would have saved at least $1,000.	0
133	TRUMP	Middle-income families will save even more money with an increased child tax credit for children under the age of 17, which so many families have been calling for.	0
134	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
135	TRUMP	We will eliminate the marriage penalty in the existing credit and expand eligibility to include even more middle-income families.	0
136	TRUMP	Greatly expanded.	0
137	TRUMP	We’re also expanding the child tax credit because we believe the most important investment our country can make is in our children.	0
138	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
139	TRUMP	And this is just one more critical way that we’re targeting relief to working families.	0
140	TRUMP	In addition, under our framework, those caring for the elderly loved — and we love these people, but we’re caring, and we take such care of the elderly and other adult dependents — will receive financial relief in the form of a $500 tax credit.	0
141	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
142	TRUMP	We’re doing everything we can to reduce the tax burden on you and your family.	0
143	TRUMP	By eliminating tax breaks and loopholes, we will ensure that the benefits are focused on the middle class, the working men and women, not the highest-income earners.	0
144	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
145	TRUMP	Our framework includes our explicit commitment that tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected.	1
146	TRUMP	They can call me all they want.	0
147	TRUMP	It’s not going to help.	0
148	TRUMP	I’m doing the right thing, and it’s not good for me.	1
149	TRUMP	Believe me.	0
150	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
151	TRUMP	But what is good for me — not only as President and legacy — what is good for me is if everything takes off like a rocket ship, like it should have for 20 years.	0
152	TRUMP	That’s good for me.	0
153	TRUMP	That’s good for everyone.	0
154	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
155	TRUMP	And that’s what I think is going to happen.	0
156	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
157	TRUMP	And a lot of very wealthy people feel the same way, believe me.	0
158	TRUMP	In fact, we are eliminating most itemized deductions that primarily benefit the wealthiest taxpayers.	0
159	TRUMP	We’ve also given Congress the flexibility to add an additional top rate on the very highest income earners to provide even more tax relief for working people.	0
160	TRUMP	Second, our framework will make the tax code simple, fair, and easy to understand, finally.	0
161	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
162	TRUMP	Americans waste money.	0
163	TRUMP	Americans waste so much money — billions and billions of dollars and many hours each year to comply with our ridiculously complex tax code.	0
164	TRUMP	More than 90 percent of Americans use assistance to prepare their taxes.	1
165	TRUMP	Under our framework, the vast majority of families will be able to file their taxes on a single sheet of paper.	0
166	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
167	TRUMP	We are also repealing the alternative minimum tax, or AMT.	0
168	TRUMP	About time.	0
169	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
170	TRUMP	The AMT is actually a shadow tax system that requires many people to calculate their taxes two different ways and pay the higher of the two amounts.	0
171	TRUMP	You’re all familiar with it.	0
172	TRUMP	Under our framework, the AMT will make even less sense because we are repealing many of the special interest tax breaks that it was designed to deal with.	0
173	TRUMP	We are making our taxes simple again.	0
174	TRUMP	We are simplifying our tax system.	0
175	TRUMP	To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax.	1
176	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
177	TRUMP	That means, especially for all of you with small businesses that are really tremendous businesses, you’ll be able to leave them to your family, and your family won’t have to run out and do a fire sale to try and get the money to pay the tax — lose the business, ends up going out of business.	0
178	TRUMP	All of those jobs are lost.	0
179	TRUMP	The farmers in particular are affected.	1
180	TRUMP	They have wonderful farms, but they can’t pay the tax, so they have to sell the farm.	1
181	TRUMP	The people that buy it don’t run it with love.	0
182	TRUMP	They can’t run it the same way, and it goes out.	0
183	TRUMP	So that death tax is a disaster for this country and a disaster for so many small businesses and farmers.	1
184	TRUMP	And we’re getting rid of it.	0
185	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
186	TRUMP	Now if you don’t like your family, it won’t matter, okay?	0
187	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
188	TRUMP	But for those that love your family, it matters a lot.	0
189	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
190	TRUMP	With us today is Kip Tom, a family farmer from Leesburg — Where’s Kip?	0
191	TRUMP	Go ahead, Kip.	0
192	TRUMP	Hi, Kip	0
193	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
194	TRUMP	 who fears that his family’s farming heritage — it’s been a long time.	0
195	TRUMP	How long, Kip?	0
196	TRUMP	A hundred and eighty-seven years — that’s peanuts, Kip.	0
197	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
198	TRUMP	Wow.	0
199	TRUMP	That’s a long time.	0
200	TRUMP	But that great heritage could come to an end because of the death tax, or the estate tax, and could make it impossible for him to pass that legacy to his wonderful family.	1
201	TRUMP	We’re not going to let that happen.	0
202	TRUMP	We are not going to allow the death tax to steal away the American Dream from these great, great families, many of which are in this room today.	0
203	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
204	TRUMP	We will protect our farmers, our ranchers, and our small businesses, and we will make taxes simple, easy, and fair for all Americans.	0
205	TRUMP	Okay?	0
206	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
207	TRUMP	Third, we will cut taxes on American businesses to restore our competitive edge and create more jobs and higher wages for American workers.	0
208	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
209	TRUMP	In Indiana, you have seen firsthand that cutting taxes on businesses makes your state more competitive and leads to more jobs and higher paychecks for your workers.	0
210	TRUMP	Now, we want to do the same thing for America, making our country more competitive with other nations.	0
211	TRUMP	And in many cases, those other nations are taking advantage of us in so many ways.	0
212	TRUMP	They say they’re friends, and perhaps they are, but believe me, I am renegotiating our trade deals, including NAFTA, including many other trade deals.	0
213	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
214	TRUMP	And through regulation, all you have to do is look at the massive pipelines — Dakota Access.	0
215	TRUMP	You take a look, 48,000 jobs immediately approved.	0
216	TRUMP	So we’re letting that happen.	0
217	TRUMP	But in terms of the tax and the tax strategy that Ronald Reagan used to create an economic boom in the 1980s: When our economy took off, the middle class thrived, and the family income of all families was increasing more and more.	0
218	TRUMP	And it was a beautiful sight to behold.	0
219	TRUMP	Since then, other nations have adopted, unfortunately, our playbook and ran it even better than we did.	0
220	TRUMP	And I shouldn’t say even better because we didn’t run it well at all, and we let other nations come in and take advantage of us and take our jobs away and take our businesses out.	0
221	TRUMP	And we’re stopping that, and you see it right here what we’ve done.	0
222	TRUMP	Today, our total business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average foreign competitor in the developed world.	1
223	TRUMP	That’s not good.	0
224	TRUMP	We have surrendered our competitive edge to other countries, but we’re not surrendering anymore.	0
225	TRUMP	We’re not surrendering anymore.	0
226	TRUMP	Under our framework, we will dramatically cut the business tax rate so that American companies and American workers can beat our foreign competitors and start winning again.	0
227	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
228	TRUMP	We will reduce the corporate tax rate to no higher than 20 percent.	0
229	TRUMP	That’s way down from 35 and 39	0
230	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
231	TRUMP	which is substantially below the average of other industrialized nations.	0
232	TRUMP	This is a revolutionary change, and the biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor, and as wages start going up at levels that you haven’t seen in many years.	0
233	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
234	TRUMP	When our companies move to other countries, it’s our loyal American workers who get hurt.	0
235	TRUMP	And when companies stay in America, and come to America, it’s our wonderful workers who reap the rewards.	0
236	TRUMP	And I just left the United Nations last week, and I was told by one of the most powerful leaders of the world that they’re going to be announcing, in the not-too-distant future, five major factories in the United States — between increasing and new — five.	0
237	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
238	TRUMP	You’ll be hearing about that very soon.	0
239	TRUMP	And I said thank you very much, and he said, “you know what?	0
240	TRUMP	It’s starting to happen in the United States.	0
241	TRUMP	It’s starting to happen.”	0
242	TRUMP	So I just wanted to let you know that.	0
243	TRUMP	I promised I wouldn’t say who.	0
244	TRUMP	I’ll keep my word.	0
245	TRUMP	Okay?	0
246	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
247	TRUMP	Unless you force me.	0
248	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
249	AUDIENCE MEMBERS	Who?	0
250	TRUMP	Members of both parties — it happens to be in the automobile industry.	0
251	TRUMP	That’s a good industry.	0
252	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
253	TRUMP	Members of both parties should agree that we need a tax code that keeps jobs in our country and brings jobs back to our country.	0
254	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
255	TRUMP	And for the millions of small businesses and farms that file their taxes as sole proprietors, S corporations or partnerships, we will cap the tax rate they pay at 25 percent — much lower.	0
256	TRUMP	Big difference.	0
257	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
258	TRUMP	This will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and mid-size businesses in this country in more than 80 years.	0
259	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
260	TRUMP	To give businesses even more reason to boost their investment in America, for the next five years, our framework will allow to fully write off — listen to this — the cost of equipment in the year they buy it.	0
261	TRUMP	That is big.	0
262	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
263	TRUMP	And that’s instead of having to take deductions and deduct the cost over a long period of time.	0
264	TRUMP	Now that’s called incentive.	0
265	TRUMP	That’s called incentive.	0
266	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
267	TRUMP	This will be tremendously important to help American businesses afford the heavy industrial machinery and other capital investments they need to grow big and grow strong.	0
268	TRUMP	Joining us today is John Gannon, the owner of a custom wood fencing and deck construction company in Indianapolis.	0
269	TRUMP	John is the father of nine children, and recently celebrated his 35th wedding anniversary.	0
270	TRUMP	Congratulations, John.	0
271	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
272	TRUMP	And John is in the fencing company, as you heard, and I’m just thinking — I have to mention this — you know, we have a fence around the White House.	0
273	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
274	TRUMP	We have a fence around the White House, and they want to build a new fence.	0
275	TRUMP	And I figured, you know — I’m pretty good at construction — I figured, I don’t know, maybe a million, maybe a million-and-a-half.	0
276	TRUMP	And this has been taking place over a long period of time — previous administrations.	0
277	TRUMP	So I said, “how much is the fence you’re talking around the White House?”	0
278	TRUMP	“Sir, the fence will cost approximately $50 million.”	0
279	TRUMP	I said, “What?”	0
280	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
281	TRUMP	I kid you not, and we have thousands of things like that.	0
282	TRUMP	Thousands.	0
283	TRUMP	We’re going to get it all down, but think of that: $50 million.	0
284	TRUMP	Now, I assume it’s a strong fence.	0
285	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
286	TRUMP	Okay?	0
287	TRUMP	So, John, do you think you could do it for slightly less than $50 million?	0
288	TRUMP	I think he could take $49 off right now and he’d have plenty of profit.	0
289	TRUMP	Right?	0
290	TRUMP	Right, John?	0
291	TRUMP	It’s crazy.	0
292	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
293	TRUMP	It’s crazy.	0
294	TRUMP	Never understand it, but we’re working on it.	0
295	TRUMP	John says that a tax cut like we’re proposing will make his business more competitive, allowing him to expand, hire more workers, and raise wages for his current employees.	0
296	TRUMP	Right, John?	0
297	TRUMP	Also with us is Aaron Williams, a father of two who works in the field of information technology.	0
298	TRUMP	Where’s Aaron?	0
299	TRUMP	Hello, Aaron.	0
300	TRUMP	Hi.	0
301	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
302	TRUMP	It’s a good field.	0
303	TRUMP	Aaron has seen the disastrous effects of high — and just literally, high corporate tax rates right up close and personal, as more and more high-tech jobs are shipped overseas.	0
304	TRUMP	You’ve been watching it, Aaron.	0
305	TRUMP	Right?	0
306	TRUMP	All over.	0
307	TRUMP	Like millions of other Americans, Aaron wants to bring those jobs back to the United States.	0
308	TRUMP	We’re going to reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they can keep jobs in America, Aaron; create jobs in America; compete for workers in America; and raise wages right here in America.	0
309	TRUMP	You’re going to be in a much different position.	0
310	TRUMP	Okay?	0
311	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
312	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
313	TRUMP	Tremendous incentives.	0
314	TRUMP	We want more products proudly stamped with those four beautiful words: Made in the USA.	0
315	TRUMP	Right?	0
316	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
317	TRUMP	Made in the USA.	0
318	TRUMP	Finally, our framework encourages American companies to bring back the trillions and trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.	0
319	TRUMP	Our current tax system	0
320	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
321	TRUMP	— trillions.	0
322	TRUMP	And by the way, for years I’ve been hearing it’s 2.5 trillion.	0
323	TRUMP	So I’ve been hearing this for about five years, so I assume it’s much more.	0
324	TRUMP	Right?	0
325	TRUMP	But Democrats want to do it, and Republicans want to do it.	0
326	TRUMP	For years — who doesn’t want to do it?	0
327	TRUMP	They want to bring — but they can’t do it because it’s so restrictive, and the taxes are so ridiculous.	0
328	TRUMP	So they can’t do it.	0
329	TRUMP	So the money stays in other countries, and it’s invested in other countries.	0
330	TRUMP	We want to bring it back.	0
331	TRUMP	But think of it, it’s one of the few things — Democrats want it and Republicans want it.	0
332	TRUMP	So they both want it, and yet for years they haven’t been able to do it.	0
333	TRUMP	Now we’re doing it.	0
334	TRUMP	We’re doing things.	0
335	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
336	TRUMP	You know, it’s one thing when we want a healthcare and they want a healthcare, and there’s a dispute.	0
337	TRUMP	But here’s something everybody wants and they can’t do it.	0
338	TRUMP	So you can tell you, there’s a broken system in D.C., but we’re getting it fixed rather — I think — rather rapidly.	0
339	TRUMP	You’ll be seeing that over the next few months.	0
340	TRUMP	Our current tax system makes us one of the few developed nations in the world to punish our companies when they bring wealth earned overseas back into our country.	0
341	TRUMP	We’re punishing them for bringing the money back in.	0
342	TRUMP	As a result, corporations have parked many trillions of dollars in foreign countries, and many have incorporated abroad in order to avoid our punitive tax system altogether.	0
343	TRUMP	And some companies actually leave our country because they have so much money overseas — so much, it’s an incredible amount — that they move the company to get their money.	0
344	TRUMP	We’re going to let them bring the money back home.	0
345	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
346	TRUMP	Our framework will stop punishing companies for keeping their headquarters in the United States.	0
347	TRUMP	We’re punishing companies under our codes for being in the United States.	0
348	TRUMP	We will impose a one-time low tax on returning money that is already offshore so that it can be brought back home to America where it belongs and where it can be put to work and work and work.	0
349	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
350	TRUMP	The framework I’ve just described represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reduce taxes, rebuild our economy, and restore America’s competitive edge.	0
351	TRUMP	Finally.	0
352	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
353	TRUMP	And I have to say, just before coming here we released some of the details of the tax and the tax reform and the tax cuts, and it has really received tremendous, tremendous reviews.	0
354	TRUMP	And if Senator Donnelly doesn’t approve it, because you know he’s on the other side, we will come here.	0
355	TRUMP	We will campaign against him like you wouldn’t believe.	0
356	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
357	TRUMP	I think they’re going to approve it.	0
358	TRUMP	I think we’ll have — actually, I think we’ll have numerous Democrats come across because it’s the right thing to do.	0
359	TRUMP	These reforms will be a dramatic change from a failed tax system that encourages American businesses to ship jobs to foreign countries that have much lower tax rates.	0
360	TRUMP	It’s what we can’t do.	0
361	TRUMP	Our competitors have much lower tax rates.	0
362	TRUMP	But no longer.	0
363	TRUMP	My administration strongly rejects this offshoring model, and we have embraced the new model.	0
364	TRUMP	It’s called — the American model.	0
365	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
366	TRUMP	Under the American model, we are reducing burdens on our businesses as long as they do business in our country.	0
367	TRUMP	That’s what we want.	0
368	TRUMP	We want them to do business in our country, not to leave our country like a number of firms from Indiana.	0
369	TRUMP	Some made some great promises to me, but those promises are only being partially kept because they’re incentivized to leave.	0
370	TRUMP	But now they’re going to be incentivized to stay.	0
371	TRUMP	And if that doesn’t work, then we’ll get even tougher than that.	0
372	TRUMP	Okay?	0
373	TRUMP	We want our companies to hire and grow in America and to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild American cities and towns.	0
374	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
375	TRUMP	That is how we will all succeed together and grow together as one team, one people, and one American family.	0
376	TRUMP	We want it to happen here.	0
377	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
378	TRUMP	Tax reform has not historically been a partisan issue, and it does not have to be a partisan issue today.	0
379	TRUMP	I really believe we’re going to have numerous Democrats come over and sign because it’s the right thing to do.	0
380	TRUMP	I believe that it’s the right thing to do, and I know many of them.	0
381	TRUMP	And they’re telling me it is the right thing to do.	0
382	TRUMP	President Reagan’s tax cuts were passed with significant bipartisan majorities at a time when there was a Democrat majority in the House and a Democrat Speaker — Tip O’Neill.	0
383	TRUMP	Before that, Democrat President John F. Kennedy championed tax cuts that surged the economy and massively reduced unemployment.	0
384	TRUMP	As President Kennedy very wisely said, “The single most important fiscal weapon available to strengthen the national economy is the federal tax policy. The right kind of tax cut at the right time” — at the right time, this is the right time — “is the most effective measure that this government could take to spur our economy forward.”	0
385	TRUMP	That was President Kennedy.	0
386	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
387	TRUMP	My fellow Americans, this is the right tax cut, and this is the right time.	0
388	TRUMP	Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people and begin middle-class miracle — it’s called a middle-class miracle, once again.	0
389	TRUMP	It’s also called a miracle for our great companies; a miracle for the middle class, for the working person.	0
390	TRUMP	I truly believe that many Democrats want to support our plan, and with enough encouragement from the American people, they will find the courage to do what is right for our great country.	0
391	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
392	TRUMP	But they’ll only do it if you, the American people, make your voices heard.	0
393	TRUMP	Only if you tell Congress to give us a tax code that puts American jobs first.	0
394	TRUMP	And that’s what we’re doing.	0
395	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
396	TRUMP	History has proven time and time again that there is no power on Earth more awesome than the will of the American people.	0
397	TRUMP	That is why today I am asking all Americans — Republican, Democrat, independent — to join with me, and with each other to demand tax reform that will truly, truly, truly make America great again.	0
398	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
399	TRUMP	Call your congressmen.	0
400	TRUMP	Call your senators.	0
401	TRUMP	Let them know you’re watching.	0
402	TRUMP	Let them know you’re waiting.	0
403	TRUMP	Tell them that today is the day for decision.	0
404	TRUMP	That now is the time to heal this self-inflicted economic wound.	0
405	TRUMP	And that with their action, the future will belong to all of us.	0
406	TRUMP	If you demand it, the politicians will listen.	0
407	TRUMP	They will answer, and they will act.	0
408	TRUMP	And someday, many years from now, our children and our grandchildren will remember this moment in history as the time when ordinary Americans took control of their destiny and chose a future of American patriotism, prosperity, and pride.	0
409	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
410	TRUMP	With your help and your voice, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our wealth, and for every citizen across this land, we will bring back our great American dreams.	0
411	TRUMP	Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.	0
412	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
