1	TRUMP	My fellow Americans:	0
2	TRUMP	Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.	1
3	TRUMP	Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country.	0
4	TRUMP	We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country.	0
5	TRUMP	America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation.	0
6	TRUMP	But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration.	1
7	TRUMP	It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages.	1
8	TRUMP	Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans.	0
9	TRUMP	Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.	1
10	TRUMP	Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border.	0
11	TRUMP	More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.	0
12	TRUMP	In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings.	1
13	TRUMP	Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now.	1
14	TRUMP	This is a humanitarian crisis — a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.	0
15	TRUMP	Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States — a dramatic increase.	0
16	TRUMP	These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.	0
17	TRUMP	One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico.	0
18	TRUMP	Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system.	0
19	TRUMP	This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border.	0
20	TRUMP	This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end.	0
21	TRUMP	My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers.	0
22	TRUMP	It’s a tremendous problem.	0
23	TRUMP	Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security.	0
24	TRUMP	These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe.	0
25	TRUMP	In fact, safer than ever before.	0
26	TRUMP	The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things.	0
27	TRUMP	We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy.	0
28	TRUMP	Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support.	0
29	TRUMP	Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home.	0
30	TRUMP	Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier.	1
31	TRUMP	At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.	1
32	TRUMP	This barrier is absolutely critical to border security.	0
33	TRUMP	It’s also what our professionals at the border want and need.	0
34	TRUMP	This is just common sense.	0
35	TRUMP	The border wall would very quickly pay for itself.	0
36	TRUMP	The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year — vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress.	0
37	TRUMP	The wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.	1
38	TRUMP	Senator Chuck Schumer — who you will be hearing from later tonight — has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats.	0
39	TRUMP	They changed their mind only after I was elected President.	0
40	TRUMP	Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis.	0
41	TRUMP	And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.	0
42	TRUMP	The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.	0
43	TRUMP	My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation.	0
44	TRUMP	But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and re-opens the government.	0
45	TRUMP	This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting.	0
46	TRUMP	I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done.	0
47	TRUMP	Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.	0
48	TRUMP	Some have suggested a barrier is immoral.	0
49	TRUMP	Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes?	0
50	TRUMP	They don’t build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside.	0
51	TRUMP	The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.	0
52	TRUMP	America’s heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien, who just came across the border.	0
53	TRUMP	The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country.	0
54	TRUMP	Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders.	0
55	TRUMP	In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history.	0
56	TRUMP	In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor.	0
57	TRUMP	In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.	0
58	TRUMP	Over the last several years, I’ve met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration.	0
59	TRUMP	I’ve held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers.	0
60	TRUMP	So sad.	0
61	TRUMP	So terrible.	0
62	TRUMP	I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls.	0
63	TRUMP	How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?	0
64	TRUMP	To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken?	0
65	TRUMP	To every member of Congress: Pass a bill that ends this crisis.	0
66	TRUMP	To every citizen: Call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border.	0
67	TRUMP	This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice.	0
68	TRUMP	This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.	0
69	TRUMP	When I took the Oath of Office, I swore to protect our country.	0
70	TRUMP	And that is what I will always do, so help me God.	0
71	TRUMP	Thank you and goodnight.	0
