1	TRUMP	Throughout the year, we have seen Democrats across the country uniting around a new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we know it and take away benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives.	1
2	TRUMP	Dishonestly called “Medicare for All,” the Democratic proposal would establish a government-run, single-payer health care system that eliminates all private and employer-based health care plans and would cost an astonishing $32.6 trillion during its first 10 years.	1
3	TRUMP	As a candidate, I promised that we would protect coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions and create new health care insurance options that would lower premiums.	1
4	TRUMP	I have kept that promise, and we are now seeing health insurance premiums coming down.	1
5	TRUMP	I also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare.	1
6	TRUMP	That is why I am fighting so hard against the Democrats' plan that would eviscerate Medicare.	0
7	TRUMP	Democrats have already harmed seniors by slashing Medicare by more than $800 billion over 10 years to pay for Obamacare.	1
8	TRUMP	Likewise, Democrats would gut Medicare with their planned government takeover of American health care.	0
9	TRUMP	The Democrats' plan threatens America's seniors.	0
10	TRUMP	The Democrats' plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice, seniors would no longer be able to depend on the benefits they were promised.	0
11	TRUMP	By eliminating Medicare as a program for seniors, and outlawing the ability of Americans to enroll in private and employer-based plans, the Democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of health care.	1
12	TRUMP	Doctors and hospitals would be put out of business.	0
13	TRUMP	Seniors would lose access to their favorite doctors.	0
14	TRUMP	There would be long wait lines for appointments and procedures.	0
15	TRUMP	Previously covered care would effectively be denied.	0
16	TRUMP	In practice, the Democratic Party’s so-called Medicare for All would really be Medicare for None.	0
17	TRUMP	Under the Democrats' plan, today’s Medicare would be forced to die.	0
18	TRUMP	The Democrats' plan also would mean the end of choice for seniors over their own health care decisions.	0
19	TRUMP	Instead, Democrats would give total power and control over seniors’ health care decisions to the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.	0
20	TRUMP	My family escaped socialism, now my fellow Democrats think we should move the party in its direction.	0
21	TRUMP	The first thing the Democratic plan will do to end choice for seniors is eliminate Medicare Advantage plans for about 20 million seniors as well as eliminate other private health plans that seniors currently use to supplement their Medicare coverage.	0
22	TRUMP	Next, the Democrats would eliminate every American’s private and employer-based health plan.	0
23	TRUMP	It is right there in their proposed legislation: Democrats outlaw private health plans that offer the same benefits as the government plan.	0
24	TRUMP	Americans might think that such an extreme, anti-senior, anti-choice and anti-consumer proposal for government-run health care would find little support among Democrats in Congress.	0
25	TRUMP	Unfortunately, they would be wrong: 123 Democrats in the House of Representatives — 64 percent of House Democrats — as well as 15 Democrats in the Senate have already formally co-sponsored this legislation.	1
26	TRUMP	Democratic nominees for governor in Florida, California and Maryland are all campaigning in support of it, as are many Democratic congressional candidates.	0
27	TRUMP	Democrats want open-borders socialism.	1
28	TRUMP	The truth is that the centrist Democratic Party is dead.	0
29	TRUMP	The new Democrats are radical socialists who want to model America’s economy after Venezuela.	0
30	TRUMP	If Democrats win control of Congress this November, we will come dangerously closer to socialism in America.	0
31	TRUMP	Government-run health care is just the beginning.	0
32	TRUMP	Democrats are also pushing massive government control of education, private-sector businesses and other major sectors of the U.S. economy.	0
33	TRUMP	Every single citizen will be harmed by such a radical shift in American culture and life.	0
34	TRUMP	Virtually everywhere it has been tried, socialism has brought suffering, misery and decay.	0
35	TRUMP	Indeed, the Democrats' commitment to government-run health care is all the more menacing to our seniors and our economy when paired with some Democrats' absolute commitment to end enforcement of our immigration laws by abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.	1
36	TRUMP	That means millions more would cross our borders illegally and take advantage of health care paid for by American taxpayers.	0
37	TRUMP	Today’s Democratic Party is for open-borders socialism.	1
38	TRUMP	This radical agenda would destroy American prosperity.	0
39	TRUMP	Under its vision, costs will spiral out of control.	0
40	TRUMP	Taxes will skyrocket.	0
41	TRUMP	And Democrats will seek to slash budgets for seniors’ Medicare, Social Security and defense.	0
42	TRUMP	Republicans believe that a Medicare program that was created for seniors and paid for by seniors their entire lives should always be protected and preserved.	0
43	TRUMP	I am committed to resolutely defending Medicare and Social Security from the radical socialist plans of the Democrats.	0
44	TRUMP	For the sake of our country, our prosperity, our seniors and all Americans — this is a fight we must win.	0
