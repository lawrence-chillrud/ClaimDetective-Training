1	BLITZER	It's time for the candidates to introduce themselves right now.	0
2	BLITZER	You'll each have 30 seconds.	0
3	BLITZER	Dr. Carson, you're first.	0
4	CARSON	If someone had tried to describe today's America to you 30 years ago, you would have listened in disbelief.	0
5	CARSON	Americans know that our nation is heading off the abyss of destruction, secondary to divisiveness, fiscal irresponsibility, and failure to lead.	0
6	CARSON	Marco, Donald, Ted, John, we will not solve any of these problems by trying to destroy each other.	0
7	CARSON	What we need to do is be looking for solutions tonight.	0
8	CARSON	It's not about us, it's about the American people.	0
9	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
10	BLITZER	Governor Kasich?	0
11	KASICH	Well, you know, on the way over here, even getting ready earlier and sitting in the green room and watching the early coverage, you know, my father carried mail on his back and his father was a coal miner and my mother's mother was an immigrant, could barely speak English.	0
12	KASICH	And I'm standing on this stage.	0
13	KASICH	It's pretty remarkable.	0
14	KASICH	But I want to tell you, there's a lot of young people watching tonight.	0
15	KASICH	You can do whatever you want to do in your life.	0
16	KASICH	America is an amazing country, where a kid like me can grow up to run for president of the United States and be on this stage tonight.	0
17	KASICH	So to all the young people that are out there, your hopes, your dreams, pursue them.	0
18	KASICH	Shoot for the stars.	0
19	KASICH	America's great, and you can do it.	0
20	KASICH	Thank you, Wolf.	0
21	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
22	BLITZER	Senator Rubio?	0
23	RUBIO	Well, thank you.	0
24	RUBIO	This election, we have to decide the identity of America in the 21st century, but as part of this primary, we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement.	0
25	RUBIO	Thirty-six years ago, Ronald Reagan and George H.W.	0
26	RUBIO	Bush began the Reagan Revolution.	0
27	RUBIO	For a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense.	0
28	RUBIO	But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams.	0
29	RUBIO	Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement, or if we're simply going to become a party that preys on people's angers and fears.	0
30	RUBIO	I hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than it's been in its story history.	0
31	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
32	BLITZER	Senator Cruz?	0
33	CRUZ	Welcome to Texas.	0
34	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
35	CRUZ	Here, Texas provided my family with hope.	0
36	CRUZ	Here, my mom became the first in her family ever to go to college.	0
37	CRUZ	Here, my dad fled Cuba and washed dishes, making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas.	0
38	CRUZ	I graduated from high school at Second Baptist not too far away from here.	0
39	CRUZ	When I ran for Senate, I promised 27 million Texans I would fight for you every day, and not for the Washington bosses.	0
40	CRUZ	And, I'll tell you, as I travel the state, Democrats tell me I didn't vote for you, but you're doing what you said you would do.	0
41	CRUZ	And, as president, I will do the same.	0
42	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
43	BLITZER	Mr. Trump.	0
44	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
45	TRUMP	My whole theme is make America great again.	0
46	TRUMP	We don't win anymore as a country.	0
47	TRUMP	We don't win with trade, we don't win with the military.	0
48	TRUMP	ISIS, we can't even knock out ISIS, and we will, believe me.	0
49	TRUMP	We will.	0
50	TRUMP	We don't win in any capacity with healthcare.	0
51	TRUMP	We have terrible health care, Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced.	0
52	TRUMP	We just don't win.	0
53	TRUMP	You look at our borders, they're like swiss cheese, everybody pours in.	0
54	TRUMP	We're going to make a great country again.	0
55	TRUMP	We're going to start winning again.	0
56	TRUMP	We're going to win a lot, it's going to be a big difference, believe me.	0
57	TRUMP	It's going to be a big difference.	0
58	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
59	BLITZER	Thank you very much.	0
60	BLITZER	It's now time to begin questions.	0
61	BLITZER	Voters in the first four states have spoken, and Mr. Trump has emerged as the frontrunner, but in five days the candidates will face their biggest test yet, Super Tuesday.	0
62	BLITZER	When nearly half of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination will be awarded, and the biggest prize of the night is Texas.	0
63	BLITZER	Immigration is a key issue in this state, for all voters nationwide, including the many people watching us on Telemundo.	0
64	BLITZER	So, that's where we begin.	0
65	BLITZER	Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States.	0
66	BLITZER	You've also promised to let what you call, "the good ones", come back in.	0
67	BLITZER	Your words, "the good ones", after they've been deported.	0
68	BLITZER	Senator Cruz would not allow them to come back in.	0
69	BLITZER	He says that's the biggest difference between the two of you.	0
70	BLITZER	He calls your plan amnesty.	0
71	BLITZER	Is it?	0
72	TRUMP	First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because they've been debating this every debate that we've had.	0
73	TRUMP	As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn't even be talking, and you wouldn't have asked that as the first question if it weren't for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration.	0
74	TRUMP	It wouldn't even be a big subject.	0
75	TRUMP	But, we either have a country, or we don't have a country.	0
76	TRUMP	We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally.	0
77	TRUMP	They will go out.	0
78	TRUMP	They will come back -- some will come back, the best, through a process.	0
79	TRUMP	They have to come back legally.	0
80	TRUMP	They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that's very fair, and very fine.	0
81	TRUMP	They're going to get in line with other people.	0
82	TRUMP	The best of them will come back, but they're going to come back through a process.	0
83	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
84	BLITZER	Senator Cruz, what's wrong with letting what Mr. Trump calls, "the good ones" come back to the United States?	0
85	CRUZ	You know, the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country -- our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs.	0
86	CRUZ	Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down.	0
87	CRUZ	You know, in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona.	0
88	CRUZ	Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state, and what's happened there -- it was a very interesting article.	1
89	CRUZ	Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing.	0
90	CRUZ	But, what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars.	1
91	CRUZ	And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise.	0
92	CRUZ	That's who we need to be fighting for.	0
93	CRUZ	Listen, we have always welcomed legal immigrants, but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens, and that's why I've led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally, and that's why I will do the same thing as president.	0
94	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
95	CRUZ	Mr. Trump, do you want to respond to that?	0
96	TRUMP	Well, I'm very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you.	0
97	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
98	BLITZER	Senator Rubio?	0
99	BLITZER	Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty, and has an add out there comparing it to President Obama's.	0
100	BLITZER	He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check, paying a fine, and paying taxes.	0
101	BLITZER	Are those claims correct?	0
102	RUBIO	Well, first of all, and before we do anything, I've been abundantly clear on this.	0
103	RUBIO	When I'm president of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border.	0
104	RUBIO	And, that's not just the physical border with Mexico, it's Visa overstays.	0
105	RUBIO	That's 45 percent of the problem right there.	0
106	RUBIO	It also has to do -- that's why we need e-verify, and entry-exit tracking system, and so-forth.	0
107	RUBIO	And, until that happens, we're not doing anything else.	0
108	RUBIO	And then we'll see what the American people are willing to support.	0
109	RUBIO	And Donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer, that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate.	0
110	RUBIO	Well, the truth is, though, that a lot of these positions that he's now taking are new to him.	0
111	RUBIO	In 2011, he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship.	0
112	RUBIO	In 2012, Donald criticized Mitt Romney, saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation.	0
113	RUBIO	And so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald, you've hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.	0
114	RUBIO	My mom and dad -- my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.	0
115	RUBIO	So I think this is an important issue.	0
116	RUBIO	And I think we are realizing increasingly that it's an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years, but finally needs to be solved once and for all.	0
117	BLITZER	Mr. Trump?	0
118	TRUMP	Well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out.	0
119	TRUMP	If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.	0
120	TRUMP	Self-deportation, as I really define it, and that's the way I define it, is you're going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out.	0
121	TRUMP	As far as the people that I've hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help.	0
122	TRUMP	It's the up season.	0
123	TRUMP	People didn't want to have part-time jobs.	0
124	TRUMP	There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn't get.	0
125	TRUMP	Everybody agrees with me on that.	0
126	TRUMP	They were part-time jobs.	0
127	TRUMP	You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn't get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.	0
128	RUBIO	That -- my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation.	0
129	RUBIO	You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.	0
130	RUBIO	And I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it.	0
131	TRUMP	I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election.	0
132	TRUMP	He should have won that election.	0
133	TRUMP	He had a failed president.	0
134	TRUMP	He ran a terrible campaign.	0
135	TRUMP	He was a terrible candidate.	0
136	TRUMP	That's what I criticize Mitt Romney -- I mean, ran...	0
137	RUBIO	No, he...	0
138	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
139	TRUMP	He ran one terrible campaign.	0
140	TRUMP	That's an election that should have been won.	0
141	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
142	RUBIO	Well, in fact, I agree we should have won and I wished we would have, but, in fact, you did criticize him for using the term "self-deportation."	0
143	RUBIO	I mean, that's on the record and people can look it up right now online.	0
144	RUBIO	But, again, I just want to reiterate, I think it's really important, this point.	0
145	RUBIO	I think it's fine, it's an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration.	0
146	RUBIO	This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country.	0
147	RUBIO	But I also think that if you're going to claim that you're the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, you're only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.	1
148	RUBIO	You hired some workers from Poland...	1
149	TRUMP	No, no, I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people.	0
150	TRUMP	You haven't hired anybody.	0
151	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
152	RUBIO	In fact, some of the people...	0
153	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
154	TRUMP	And by the way, I've hired -- and by the way, I've hired tens of thousands of people over at my job.	0
155	TRUMP	You've hired nobody.	0
156	RUBIO	Yes, you've hired a thousand from another country...	0
157	TRUMP	You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera.	0
158	TRUMP	So don't tell me about that.	0
159	RUBIO	Let me just say -- let me finish the statement.	0
160	RUBIO	This is important.	0
161	TRUMP	You haven't hired one person, you liar.	0
162	RUBIO	He hired workers from Poland.	1
163	RUBIO	And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from...	1
164	TRUMP	That's wrong.	1
165	TRUMP	That's wrong.	1
166	TRUMP	Totally wrong.	1
167	RUBIO	That's a fact.	1
168	RUBIO	People can look it up.	0
169	RUBIO	I'm sure people are Googling it right now.	0
170	RUBIO	Look it up.	0
171	RUBIO	Trump Polish workers, you'll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects.	1
172	RUBIO	He did it.	1
173	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
174	RUBIO	That happened.	1
175	TRUMP	I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.	0
176	TRUMP	Tens of thousands...	0
177	RUBIO	Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans.	0
178	TRUMP	Be quiet.	0
179	TRUMP	Just be quiet.	0
180	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
181	TRUMP	Let me talk.	0
182	TRUMP	I've hired tens of thousands of people.	0
183	TRUMP	He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well.	0
184	TRUMP	Everybody was happy.	0
185	RUBIO	You paid a million dollars.	1
186	TRUMP	And by the way, the laws were totally different.	0
187	TRUMP	That was a whole different world.	0
188	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
189	TRUMP	But I've hired people.	0
190	TRUMP	Nobody up here has hired anybody.	0
191	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
192	BLITZER	Senator Cruz, you say you want to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants, but you never want to allow them to come back to the United States.	0
193	BLITZER	What would happen to the children who are U.S.- born citizens whose parent will be deported under your plan?	0
194	CRUZ	Well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally.	0
195	CRUZ	U.S. citizens can come back.	0
196	CRUZ	That's existing law.	0
197	CRUZ	But let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration.	0
198	CRUZ	I can tell you, when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall.	0
199	CRUZ	And in 2013, when I was fight against the "gang of eight" amnesty bill, where was Donald?	0
200	CRUZ	He was firing Dennis Rodman on "Celebrity Apprentice."	0
201	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
202	CRUZ	And indeed, if you look at the "gang of eight," one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill.	0
203	CRUZ	If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans.	1
204	CRUZ	And when you're funding open border politicians, you shouldn't be surprised when they fight for open borders.	0
205	CRUZ	And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through, you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty.	0
206	CRUZ	And I'm the only one on this stage that has that record.	0
207	CRUZ	And by the way, Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him.	1
208	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
209	BLITZER	Mr. Trump?	0
210	TRUMP	I can only say this, and I've said it loud and clear and I've said it for years.	0
211	TRUMP	And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now -- your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they're packed with you.	0
212	TRUMP	I've had an amazing relationship with politicians -- with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman.	0
213	TRUMP	As one magazine said, he's a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody.	0
214	TRUMP	I got along with everybody.	0
215	TRUMP	You get along with nobody.	0
216	TRUMP	You don't have one Republican -- you don't have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time.	0
217	TRUMP	These are minor details.	0
218	TRUMP	But you don't have one Republican senator backing you; not one.	0
219	TRUMP	You don't have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people.	0
220	TRUMP	You should be ashamed of yourself.	0
221	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
222	BLITZER	Senator Cruz?	0
223	CRUZ	You know, I actually think Donald is right.	0
224	CRUZ	He is promising if he's elected he will go and cut deals in Washington.	0
225	CRUZ	And he's right.	0
226	CRUZ	He has supported -- he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats.	0
227	CRUZ	Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be hiring illegal immigrants.	0
228	CRUZ	Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; wouldn't be funding the Gang of Eight.	0
229	CRUZ	And, you know, he is right.	0
230	CRUZ	When you stand up to Washington, when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption, enough with the cronyism, let's actually stand for the working men and women of this country, Washington doesn't like it.	0
231	CRUZ	And Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, that's not a good attribute for a president.	0
232	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
233	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
234	TRUMP	Here's a man -- Robin Hood.	0
235	TRUMP	This is Robin Hood over here.	0
236	TRUMP	He talks about corruption.	0
237	TRUMP	On his financial disclosure form, he didn't even put that he's borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs, which is a total violation.	0
238	TRUMP	He didn't talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest.	0
239	TRUMP	He just left it off, and now he's going to protect the people from the big bad banks.	0
240	TRUMP	Give me a break.	0
241	BLITZER	All right.	0
242	BLITZER	We're going to move on to Governor Kasich.	0
243	BLITZER	Governor Kasich...	0
244	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
245	CRUZ	Wolf, can I respond to that attack?	0
246	BLITZER	You can respond, but let me get Governor Kasich in.	0
247	BLITZER	He's been waiting patiently.	0
248	BLITZER	Governor Kasich, the idea -- you've said this, and I want to quote you now "The idea that we're going to deport all these people is ludicrous and everybody knows it."	0
249	BLITZER	Those are your words.	0
250	BLITZER	Should people be allowed to break the law just because it's not feasible to stop them?	0
251	KASICH	Look, we have a great president here, George Bush, the 41st president of the United States.	0
252	KASICH	He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem -- a path to legalization.	0
253	KASICH	You see, that was a time when things worked.	0
254	KASICH	It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work.	0
255	KASICH	Look, I think there is an answer here.	0
256	KASICH	The answer is you complete the border.	0
257	KASICH	You let people know that once it's done, you don't have a right to come in.	0
258	KASICH	If you come in, we don't want any excuse.	0
259	KASICH	You're going to go back.	0
260	KASICH	But I favor a guest worker program.	0
261	KASICH	I think it's practical.	0
262	KASICH	And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans -- the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, I'd make them pay a fine, some back taxes, maybe some community service.	0
263	KASICH	And at the end, I'd give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship.	0
264	KASICH	I don't think we're going to tear families apart.	0
265	KASICH	I don't think we're going to ride around in people's neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes.	0
266	KASICH	I don't think -- first of all, I don't think it's practical and I don't think it reflects America.	0
267	KASICH	You know what happened?	0
268	KASICH	The problem with President Reagan is we didn't get in there and actually finish the border.	0
269	KASICH	And I think it was probably business interests that affected it.	0
270	KASICH	But at the end of the day, let's be practical.	0
271	KASICH	Let's start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs.	0
272	KASICH	With President Reagan and George Bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and I think we can and should do it again.	0
273	KASICH	And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us.	0
274	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
275	BLITZER	Thank you, Governor.	0
276	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
277	BLITZER	Dr. Carson, you've been critical of mass deportation.	0
278	BLITZER	You said back in November you don't think Mr. Trump's plan necessarily represents the Republican Party.	0
279	BLITZER	Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters, do you still believe that?	0
280	CARSON	I believe in liberty and justice for all.	0
281	CARSON	I think everything that we do should be fair.	0
282	CARSON	And I've already described -- you know, how we can secure the border.	0
283	CARSON	We need to secure all the borders, because it's not just people coming in from South America and Mexico, but there are terrorists who want to destroy us, who are getting across our borders fairly easily.	0
284	CARSON	And we have to stop that.	0
285	CARSON	But in terms of the people who are here already, after we -- after we stop the illegal immigration, we need to be reasonable.	0
286	CARSON	And I would give them a six-month period in which to get registered as a guest worker, assuming that they have an acceptable record.	0
287	CARSON	They have to pay a back-tax penalty, have to pay taxes going forward, but they don't have to live underground anymore.	0
288	CARSON	And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote.	0
289	CARSON	If they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through.	0
290	CARSON	I think that's the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.	0
291	CARSON	 And we have other ways of -- of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there, so that they don't feel the need to come over here.	0
292	CARSON	That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China, paying interest on it.	0
293	BLITZER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.	0
294	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
295	BLITZER	Mr. Trump, your campaign, as you well remember, began with the idea of building a wall along the southern border.	0
296	TRUMP	(inaudible).	0
297	BLITZER	It's about 315 miles southwest of where we are right now.	0
298	BLITZER	You've said the Mexican government will pay for it.	0
299	TRUMP	Correct.	0
300	BLITZER	The spokesperson for the current president of Mexico says that will never happen.	0
301	BLITZER	The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen.	0
302	BLITZER	In fact, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox -- he said today, and I'm quoting him -- he said, "I'm not going to pay for that," quote, "effing wall."	0
303	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
304	BLITZER	So if you don't get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?	0
305	TRUMP	I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.	0
306	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
307	TRUMP	It just got 10 feet taller.	0
308	TRUMP	I saw him make that -- I saw him make the statement.	0
309	TRUMP	I saw him use the word that he used.	0
310	TRUMP	I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal.	0
311	TRUMP	This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK?	0
312	TRUMP	Number one.	0
313	TRUMP	Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year.	0
314	TRUMP	And that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.	0
315	TRUMP	We're going to make them pay for that wall.	0
316	TRUMP	Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it.	0
317	TRUMP	If these guys do it, it'll end up costing $200 billion.	0
318	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
319	TRUMP	But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion.	0
320	TRUMP	You need 1,000 -- you need 1,000 miles.	0
321	TRUMP	The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago -- 2,000, is 13,000 miles.	0
322	TRUMP	We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers.	0
323	TRUMP	We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and it's a real wall.	0
324	TRUMP	This is a wall that's a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you're looking at.	0
325	TRUMP	This is a wall that's going to work.	0
326	TRUMP	Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors.	0
327	TRUMP	They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to...	0
328	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
329	TRUMP	... immediately.	0
330	TRUMP	Mexico will pay for the wall.	0
331	TRUMP	It's a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico.	0
332	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
333	BLITZER	If the -- if the Mexicans don't pay for the wall, will you start a trade war with Mexico?	0
334	TRUMP	Well, you know, I don't mind trade wars when we're losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth.	0
335	TRUMP	We're losing so much.	0
336	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
337	TRUMP	We're losing so much with Mexico and China -- with China, we're losing $500 billion a year.	0
338	TRUMP	And then people say, "don't we want to trade?"	0
339	TRUMP	I don't mind trading, but I don't want to lose $500 billion.	0
340	TRUMP	I don't want to lose $58 billion.	0
341	TRUMP	Mexico just took Carrier Corporation, maker of air conditioners.	0
342	TRUMP	They just took Ford.	0
343	TRUMP	They're building a $2.5 billion plant.	0
344	TRUMP	They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.	0
345	TRUMP	And I always say I'm not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way.	0
346	TRUMP	But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico.	0
347	TRUMP	They're taking our businesses.	0
348	TRUMP	I don't mind.	0
349	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
350	BLITZER	Senator Rubio?	0
351	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
352	RUBIO	Yeah, a couple points.	0
353	RUBIO	If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it.	0
354	RUBIO	The second...	0
355	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
356	TRUMP	Such a cute sound bite.	0
357	RUBIO	But it -- no, it's not a sound bite.	0

359	RUBIO	Again, go online and Google it.	0
360	RUBIO	Donald Trump, Polish workers.	0
361	RUBIO	You'll see it.	0
362	RUBIO	The second thing, about the trade war -- I don't understand, because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China.	0
363	RUBIO	So you're gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.	0
364	TRUMP	All right, you know what?	0
365	RUBIO	Why don't you make them in America?	0
366	TRUMP	Because they devalue their currency -- they devalue their currencies...	0
367	RUBIO	Well, then make them in America.	0
368	TRUMP	... that makes it -- well, you don't know a thing about business.	0
369	TRUMP	You lose on everything...	0
370	RUBIO	Well, make them in America.	0
371	TRUMP	Let me just tell you -- they de-value their currency.	0
372	TRUMP	They de-value their currencies.	0
373	RUBIO	Well then, make them in America.	0
374	TRUMP	That makes it -- well, you don't know a thing about business.	0
375	TRUMP	You lose on everything you do.	0
376	RUBIO	Well, make them in America.	0
377	TRUMP	Let me just tell you, they de-value their currencies.	0
378	TRUMP	China, Mexico, everybody.	0
379	TRUMP	Japan with the cars.	0
380	TRUMP	They de-value their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them, our workers lose their jobs...	0
381	RUBIO	And so you make them in China and in Russia.	0
382	TRUMP	But you wouldn't know anything about it because you're a lousy businessman.	0
383	RUBIO	Well, I don't know anything about bankrupting four companies.	0
384	RUBIO	You've bankrupted..	0
385	TRUMP	No, I -- and you know why?	0

393	BLITZER	One at a time.	0

398	RUBIO	... to go to Trump University, and they're suing now -- $36,000 to go to a university...	0
399	TRUMP	And by the way -- and by the way...	0
400	RUBIO	... that's a fake school.	0
401	TRUMP	... and by the way...	0
402	RUBIO	And you know what they got?	0
403	RUBIO	They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump...	0
404	TRUMP	I've won most of the lawsuits.	0
405	RUBIO	That's what they got for $36,000.	0
406	BLITZER	All right, I want to move on.	0
407	TRUMP	And they actually did a very good job, but I've won most of the lawsuits.	0
408	BLITZER	Mr. Trump, Senator, I want to bring in...	0
409	RUBIO	Most of the lawsuits.	0
410	BLITZER	I want to bring in my colleague Maria Celeste.	0

421	TRUMP	You tell me about this guy.	0
422	TRUMP	This is what we're going to have as president.	0
423	RUBIO	Here's a guy that inherited $200 million.	0
424	RUBIO	If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now?	0

430	TRUMP	That is so wrong.	0
431	TRUMP	We'll work on that.	0
432	TRUMP	I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion.	0
433	RUBIO	Oh, OK. One million.	0
434	TRUMP	I borrowed $1 million...	0
435	RUBIO	Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made.	0
436	TRUMP	I borrowed $1 million, I turned it into $10 billion...	0
437	RUBIO	Oh, he doesn't make that money.	0
438	TRUMP	... more than $10 billion.	0
439	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
440	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
441	BLITZER	I want to bring in Maria Celeste of Telemundo.	0
442	BLITZER	Maria?	0
443	CELESTE	Senator Rubio, last week, you said that on your first day in office, you will get rid of President Obama's executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA for short.	0
444	RUBIO	Correct.	0
445	CELESTE	It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children, brought to the U.S. by undocumented immigrants.	0
446	CELESTE	This is the only home they know, and that is a dramatic change from last April when you said in Spanish, and I'm going to quote you (in Spanish) which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point, but it wouldn't be fair to cancel it immediately.	0
447	CELESTE	So Senator Rubio, what changed?	0
448	RUBIO	It didn't change.	0
449	CELESTE	Why is it now fair to cancel it on Day One?	0
450	RUBIO	No, it's the same policy.	0
451	RUBIO	It will have to end at some moment, and as I said, we will -- we will eliminate that executive order.	0
452	RUBIO	The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it, and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it.	0
453	RUBIO	And it's not because we're not compassionate to the plight of a 2 -- someone who came here when they were 2 years old.	0
454	RUBIO	I understand.	0
455	RUBIO	I know people that are personally impacted by this.	0
456	RUBIO	The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional.	0
457	RUBIO	The president doesn't have the power to do that.	0
458	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
459	RUBIO	And he himself admitted that.	0
460	CELESTE	Senator, Senator...	0
461	RUBIO	I'm sorry, but let me finish my...	0
462	CELESTE	... but you went -- you went from saying that it was deeply disruptive to deport them immediately to deport them on Day One.	0
463	RUBIO	No, but this is not about deportation.	0
464	RUBIO	Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation.	0
465	RUBIO	This is about DACA.	0
466	RUBIO	DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional.	0
467	RUBIO	I will cancel it on my first day in office, which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire, and new people will not be allowed to apply for them.	0
468	RUBIO	Now, I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own, but you can't solve it doing something that is unconstitutional.	0
469	RUBIO	No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause, we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis.	0
470	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
471	CELESTE	Senator Rubio, you accused Senator Cruz in a previous debate of lying when he said that you said one thing in Spanish and another one in English.	0
472	CELESTE	So in what sense did he lie?	0
473	RUBIO	Because it is not true that I'm not going to get rid of DACA.	0
474	RUBIO	I am going to get rid of DACA.	0
475	RUBIO	In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish, I said, it will have to end at some point.	0
476	RUBIO	That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it.	0
477	RUBIO	And new people will not be able to apply.	0
478	RUBIO	In fact, I don't even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now.	0
479	RUBIO	That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it, when the program expires, they cannot renew it, and it goes away.	0
480	RUBIO	But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I take -- as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office.	0
481	TRUMP	I have to say, he lied this time.	0
482	TRUMP	He lied.	0
483	TRUMP	100 percent.	0
484	TRUMP	100 percent.	0
485	RUBIO	You lied about the Polish workers.	0
486	TRUMP	Yes, yes, yes.	0
487	TRUMP	38 years ago.	0
488	RUBIO	You lied to the students at Trump University.	0
489	CELESTE	Let Senator Cruz jump in.	0
490	RUBIO	Oh, he lied 38 years ago.	0
491	RUBIO	All right, I guess there's a statute of limitation on lies.	0
492	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
493	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
494	CRUZ	Well Maria, I would note you made the exact same point here that I made at the last debate, and you're right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that.	0
495	CRUZ	You know, we've both seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal, or unconstitutional program.	0
496	CRUZ	Well, it'll have to end some day, not immediately, but someday in the future.	0
497	CRUZ	That, inevitably, is when a politician doesn't plan to end it at all.	0
498	CRUZ	You know, I'm reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies.	0
499	CRUZ	When I campaigned in Iowa, I took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies.	0
500	CRUZ	Marco's position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty.	0
501	CRUZ	Well, someday it should end, just not now.	0
502	CRUZ	And, frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it's somebody else's problem.	0
503	RUBIO	That's not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol.	0
504	RUBIO	What I said is that ethanol will phase out, it is phasing out now.	0
505	RUBIO	By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law, and at that point it will go away.	0
506	RUBIO	I don't agree with the mandate and the program that's in place, but I think it's unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and we're just going to yank it away from them.	0
507	RUBIO	And, again, you read the statement in Spanish.	0
508	RUBIO	I said very clearly on Spanish television, DACA will have to end at some point, and that point is -- at that time I was not a candidate for president.	0
509	RUBIO	I said it will end in my first day in office as president, and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it.	0
510	RUBIO	New applicants will not be able to apply.	0
511	RUBIO	That is the end of DACA.	0
512	RUBIO	I am sympathetic to this cause, but once again, it cannot supersede the Constitution of the United States which this president habitually and routinely every single day ignores and violates.	0
513	SYSTEM	(CHEERING)	0
514	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
515	CELESTE	Senator Cruz, you and Senator Rubio are the two candidates of hispanic descent on this stage.	0
516	CELESTE	As a matter of fact, you are the first hispanic candidate ever to win a caucus or primary.	0
517	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
518	CELESTE	And yet, there is the perception in the Latino community that instead of trying to prove to Latinos who has the best plan, the best platform to help them, that you two are spending the time arguing with each other.	0
519	CELESTE	Trying to figure out which one is tougher on immigration in order to appeal to the majority of Republicans.	0
520	CELESTE	So, my question to you is are you missing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican base?	0
521	CRUZ	Well, Maria, you are right.	0
522	CRUZ	It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants.	0
523	CRUZ	It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides.	0
524	CRUZ	You know, I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you're liberal.	0
525	CRUZ	That makes sense in the media, but I gotta tell you, one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas, I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas.	0
526	CRUZ	At the same time, Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide.	0
527	CRUZ	And, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community.	0
528	CRUZ	The values in our community are faith, family, patriotism.	0
529	CRUZ	You know, we've got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country.	0
530	CRUZ	And, when I campaigned, and I campaigned the same here in Houston or Dallas as I did in the Rio Grande Valley, defending conservative principles, defending judeo- Christian principals, telling my father's story.	0
531	CRUZ	Telling my Dad's story of coming to America with $100 dollars in his underwear, not speaking English, washing dishes, having hopes and dreams for the American dream.	0
532	CRUZ	And, the truth is the Obama-Clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community.	0
533	CRUZ	It is not working in the hispanic community, and I...	0
534	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGING)	0
535	CRUZ	... fighting so that everyone who is struggling in the hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the American dream.	0
536	RUBIO	I'm sorry I was mentioned...	0
537	CELESTE	Governor Kasich.	0
538	RUBIO	Maria I was mentioned in that.	0
539	RUBIO	I was mentioned in that statement.	0
540	CELESTE	Governor Kasich, after the...	0
541	RUBIO	... OK.	0
542	RUBIO	I was mentioned -- just because of the hispanic -- and I'll be brief.	0
543	RUBIO	A couple points, number one, I do think it's amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin, and an African American.	0
544	RUBIO	We are the party of diversity, not the Democratic party.	0
545	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
546	SYSTEM	(CHEERING)	0
547	RUBIO	And, the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.	0
548	RUBIO	Yes, it's an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it.	0
549	RUBIO	But, I'm going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community, as it is in every immigrant community, is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself...	0
550	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGING)	0
551	RUBIO	... and, you can only do that through free enterprise.	0
552	RUBIO	That's what we stand for, not socialism like Bernie Sanders, and increasingly Hillary Clinton.	0
553	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
554	CELESTE	Governor Kasich, after the last presidential election the Republican party realized that in order to win the presidency it needed the support of latinos.	0
555	CELESTE	Guidelines as to how to accomplish that were spelled out in an autopsy (ph) report that concluded, and I'm going to quote it, "if hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn't want them in the United States they won't pay attention to our next sentence."	0
556	CELESTE	So, do you think that your fellow Republican candidates get it?	0
557	KASICH	Well, I'm not going to talk about that.	0
558	KASICH	I mean, I've got to tell you, I was with this little 12-year-old girl, was at a town hall meeting, and she said, you know, I don't like all this yelling and screaming at the debates.	0
559	KASICH	My mother's thinking I might not be able to watch the thing anymore.	0
560	KASICH	I think we ought to move beyond that, about what they think.	0
561	KASICH	I'm going to tell you what I think.	0
562	KASICH	My position on this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning.	0
563	KASICH	I haven't changed anything with it.	0
564	KASICH	And, look, my view is, we need economic growth.	0
565	KASICH	Everything starts with economic growth.	0
566	KASICH	And how do you get it?	0
567	KASICH	Common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget.	0
568	KASICH	That gives you economic growth.	0
569	KASICH	I did it when I was in Washington, as the Budget Committee chairman, negotiating actually with Democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in Ohio.	0
570	KASICH	But here's the thing that I believe.	0
571	KASICH	Economic growth is not an end unto itself.	0
572	KASICH	We have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise.	0
573	KASICH	Of course, our friends in the Hispanic community, our friends in the African-American community, the promise of America is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone.	0
574	KASICH	It's what Jack Kemp used to say.	0
575	KASICH	A rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats.	0
576	KASICH	And you know what?	0
577	KASICH	With me and the Hispanic community, I think they like me.	0
578	KASICH	And I appreciate that, because I want them to have the same opportunity that I and my children and my wife and the people we love have had in this country.	0
579	KASICH	It's time to solve problems.	0
580	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
581	CELESTE	Dr. Carson, concerning this recommendation of the report, are you, as a candidate, getting it?	0
582	CARSON	I didn't hear the first part of the question?	0
583	CELESTE	The first part of the question is, there was a report that recommended that in order to approach Hispanics and bring them to vote for the Republican Party, certain things needed to happen.	0
584	CELESTE	And one of them was that they shouldn't feel like they were going to get kicked out of the United States, otherwise they wouldn't pay attention to one more sentence from candidates.	0
585	CARSON	OK, well, first of all, let me just mention that last year at the NALEO, the National Association for Latino Elected Officials, I was the only one of 17 Republican candidates to go there.	0
586	CARSON	And the reason that I don't fear going to an organization like that is because the message that I give is the same message to every group.	0
587	CARSON	You know, this is America.	0
588	CARSON	And we need to have policies that are -- that give liberty and justice to all people.	0
589	CARSON	And that's the way that I have fashioned virtually every policy, looking at that.	0
590	CARSON	And I think that's the way the Republican Party generally thinks.	0
591	CARSON	We don't pick and choose winners and losers.	0
592	CARSON	We are compassionate.	0
593	CARSON	But real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of America.	0
594	CARSON	When we begin to emphasize that, I think we will attract everybody.	0
595	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
596	CELESTE	Mr. Trump, it is common knowledge that the Hispanic vote is very important in this race.	0
597	CELESTE	You keep saying that Hispanics love you.	0
598	TRUMP	True.	0
599	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
600	CELESTE	And, yes, you won the Hispanic vote in Nevada.	0
601	TRUMP	True.	0
602	CELESTE	But a brand new Telemundo poll says that three out of four Hispanics that vote nationwide have a negative opinion of you.	0
603	CELESTE	They don't like you.	0
604	CELESTE	Wouldn't that make you an unelectable...	0
605	TRUMP	No.	0
606	CELESTE	... candidate in a general election?	0
607	TRUMP	First of all, I don't believe anything Telemundo says.	0
608	CELESTE	You used to say that you love...	0
609	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
610	TRUMP	Number one.	0
611	TRUMP	Number two, I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years, I've employed tens of thousands of Hispanics.	0
612	TRUMP	They're incredible people.	0
613	TRUMP	They know, and the reason I won in Nevada, not only won the big one, but I also won subs, like, as an example, I won with women.	0
614	TRUMP	I won with every single category.	0
615	TRUMP	I won with men, I won with high-income, low-income, I won with Hispanics.	0
616	TRUMP	And I got 46 percent.	0
617	TRUMP	Nobody else was close.	0
618	TRUMP	Because they know I'm going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places.	0
619	TRUMP	They get it.	0
620	TRUMP	They're incredible people.	0
621	TRUMP	They're incredible workers.	0
622	TRUMP	They get it.	0
623	TRUMP	And I've won many of the polls with Hispanics.	0
624	TRUMP	I didn't maybe win the Telemundo poll.	0
625	TRUMP	But one thing I'm also going to do, I'm going to be getting -- bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are independents, and you're seeing that with the polls, because if you look at anywhere, look at any of the elections, every single election, it has been record-setting.	0
626	TRUMP	And the good news is, for the Republican Party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in.	0
627	TRUMP	We're getting record-setting numbers.	0
628	TRUMP	I think I have something to do with that.	0
629	TRUMP	We're getting record-setting numbers.	0
630	TRUMP	And I won every one -- the three of them that I won, I won with record-setting numbers.	0
631	TRUMP	New people are coming into the Republican Party.	0
632	TRUMP	We are building a new Republican Party, a lot of new people are coming in.	0
633	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
634	CELESTE	For the record, you have said publicly that you loved Telemundo in the past.	0
635	CELESTE	But it is not just a Telemundo poll.	0
636	CELESTE	We have...	0
637	TRUMP	I love them.	0
638	TRUMP	I love them.	0
639	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
640	CELESTE	All right.	0
641	CELESTE	Well, it's not the only poll.	0
642	TRUMP	They're fine.	0
643	TRUMP	Do you know what?	0
644	TRUMP	They're fine.	0
645	CELESTE	Just last night -- let me -- let me finish, please.	0
646	CELESTE	Just last night, The Washington Post showed that 80 percent of Hispanic voters in their polls have a negative view of you.	0
647	CELESTE	And concerning the Nevada victory, allow me to explain that the poll in Nevada was based on a tiny sample, statistically insignificant of only about 100 -- let me finish please -- of 100 Hispanic Republicans in the state of Nevada.	0
648	TRUMP	Why did they take the poll?	0
649	TRUMP	Why did they...	0
650	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
651	CELESTE	I am making reference -- I am making reference to Hispanic voters nationwide in a general election.	0
652	TRUMP	I'm just telling you, I'm doing very well with Hispanics.	0
653	TRUMP	And by the way, I settled my suit, as you know, with Univision.	0
654	TRUMP	It was settled.	0
655	TRUMP	We're good friends now.	0
656	TRUMP	It was all settled up.	0
657	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
658	TRUMP	Very happy, very happy.	0
659	TRUMP	Very good people.	0
660	TRUMP	I'm just telling you -- I'm just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics.	0
661	TRUMP	I will do better than anybody on this stage.	0
662	TRUMP	I have respect for the people on the stage, but I will do very well with Hispanics.	0
663	TRUMP	But I'm telling you also, I'm bringing people, Democrats over and I'm bringing independents over, and we're building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party.	0
664	BLITZER	Mr. Trump, thank you.	0
665	BLITZER	I want to turn our attention now to another critically important issue for the American people, the United States Supreme Court, where filling the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia has become a major campaign issue.	0
666	BLITZER	I want to bring in Salem Radio Network host, Hugh Hewitt.	0
667	BLITZER	Hugh?	0
668	HEWITT	Thank you, Wolf.	0
669	HEWITT	To me, it's the most important issue.	0
670	HEWITT	I'll start with you, Senator Cruz.	0
671	HEWITT	Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices?	0
672	CRUZ	Well, Hugh, I agree with you that it -- Justice Scalia's passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election.	0
673	CRUZ	Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend.	0
674	CRUZ	And with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance.	0
675	CRUZ	We are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms from the Constitution.	0
676	CRUZ	Now, I think the voters of Texas, the voters across Super Tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this -- this stage.	0
677	CRUZ	In the past, Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists.	0
678	CRUZ	So I'm certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that.	0
679	CRUZ	But the reality is, Democrats bat about 1,000.	0
680	CRUZ	Just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want.	0
681	CRUZ	Republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster.	0
682	CRUZ	I've spent my whole life fighting to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. I can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the Second Amendment, they're asking the question "Who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court?"	0
683	CRUZ	I give you my word, every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours.	0
684	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
685	HEWITT	Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz mentioned the issue that keeps me up at night, which is religious liberty.	0
686	HEWITT	Churches, Catholic and Christian colleges, Catholic adoption agencies -- all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby, if it's repealed, it was a five-four decision, they're going to have to bend their knee and provide morning-after pills.	0
687	HEWITT	They fear that if Bob Jones is expanded, they will lose their tax exemption.	0
688	HEWITT	Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint, not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?	0
689	TRUMP	Yes, I would.	0
690	TRUMP	And I've been there.	0
691	TRUMP	And I've been there very strongly.	0
692	TRUMP	I do have to say something, and this is interesting and it's not anybody's fault.	0
693	TRUMP	It's not Ted's fault.	0
694	TRUMP	Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted.	0
695	TRUMP	Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare.	0
696	TRUMP	Might as well be called Roberts-care.	0
697	TRUMP	Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve.	0
698	TRUMP	And we ended up with Obamacare.	0
699	TRUMP	That is a rough thing.	0
700	TRUMP	And I know Ted feels badly about it.	0
701	TRUMP	And I think he probably still respects the judge.	0
702	TRUMP	But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way -- no way that he should have approved Obamacare.	0
703	TRUMP	Now, with that being said, these are the things that happen.	0
704	TRUMP	But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don't want.	0
705	HEWITT	Ted Cruz, Senator, the chief justice got Hobby Lobby right, but what do you make of Mr. Cruz's criticism?	0
706	CRUZ	Well, listen -- Donald knows that it was George W. Bush who appointed John Roberts.	0
707	CRUZ	Yes, it's true, I supported the Republican nominee once he was made.	0
708	CRUZ	But I would not have nominated John Roberts.	0
709	CRUZ	I would have nominated my former boss, Mike Luttig, who was the strongest proven conservative on the court of appeals.	0
710	CRUZ	And I'll tell you, Hugh...	0
711	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
712	CRUZ	... you know, it's interesting now that Donald promises that he will appoint justices who -- who will defend religious liberty, but this is a man who, for 40 years, has given money to Jimmy Carter, to Joe Biden, to Hillary Clinton, to Chuck Schumer, to Harry Reid.	0
713	CRUZ	Nobody who supports far-left liberal Democrats who are fighting for judicial activists can possibly care about having principled constitutionalists on the court.	0
714	CRUZ	And what Donald has told us is he will go to Washington...	0
715	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
716	CRUZ	... and cut a deal.	0
717	HEWITT	Mr. Trump...	0
718	CRUZ	So that means on Supreme Court...	0
719	HEWITT	... can I...	0
720	CRUZ	... he's going to look to cut a deal, rather than fight for someone who won't cut a deal on the Constitution, but will defend it faithfully.	0
721	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
722	HEWITT	Can I trust you on religious liberty?	0
723	TRUMP	Well, let -- let me -- let me just say -- let me just say this.	0
724	TRUMP	Look, I watched Ted -- and I respected it, but he gets nowhere -- stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk.	0
725	TRUMP	I watched the other senators laughing and smiling.	0
726	TRUMP	And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work.	0
727	TRUMP	OK?	0
728	TRUMP	We have to have somebody that's going to make deals.	0
729	TRUMP	It's wonderful to stand up for two days and do that.	0
730	TRUMP	Now, Ted's been very critical -- I have a sister who's a brilliant...	0
731	HEWITT	Mr. Cruz, will you make a deal about religious liberty?	0
732	TRUMP	... excuse me.	0
733	TRUMP	She's a brilliant judge.	0
734	TRUMP	He's been criticizing -- he's been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill.	0
735	TRUMP	You know who else signed that bill?	0
736	TRUMP	Justice Samuel Alito, a very conservative member of the Supreme Court, with my sister, signed that bill.	0
737	TRUMP	So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted.	0
738	TRUMP	What do you think?	0
739	HEWITT	Let me -- Senator.	0
740	CRUZ	Let me tell you right now, Donald, I will not apologize for a minute for defending the Constitution.	0
741	CRUZ	I will not apologize for defending the Bill of Rights.	0
742	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
743	CRUZ	And I find it amazing that your answer to Hugh and to the American people is, on religious liberty, you can't have one of the these crazy zealots that actually believes in it.	0
744	CRUZ	You've got to be willing to cut a deal.	0
745	CRUZ	And you know, there is a reason why, when Harry Reid was asked, of all the people on this stage, who does he want the most, who does he like the most, Harry Reid said Donald -- Donald Trump.	1
746	CRUZ	Why?	0
747	CRUZ	Because Donald has supported him in the past, and he knows he can cut a deal with him.	1
748	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
749	CRUZ	You know what, Donald...	0
750	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
751	HEWITT	Senator Rubio.	0
752	CRUZ	I don't want a Supreme Court justice that you cut a deal with Harry Reid to undermine religious liberty, because that same justice will also erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.	0
753	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
754	TRUMP	When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you?	0
755	TRUMP	Crazy zealot -- give me a break.	0
756	HEWITT	Senator Rubio, you've heard this exchange on religious liberty.	0
757	HEWITT	You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from same-sex marriages, not provide flowers, not provide baked goods, et cetera.	0
758	HEWITT	Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?	0
759	RUBIO	Well, I think you ask a very important question, because the issue here -- the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy.	0
760	RUBIO	Justice Scalia -- in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document -- it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.	0
761	RUBIO	And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia -- plus there may be at least two other vacancies.	0
762	RUBIO	So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would.	0
763	RUBIO	But the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side.	0
764	RUBIO	Now, if he's changed, we're always looking for converts into the conservative movement.	0
765	RUBIO	But the bottom line is that, if (ph) you don't have a record there to look at and say, "I feel at peace that when Donald Trump is president of the United States, he's going to be firmly on our side on these issues."	0
766	RUBIO	In fact, very recently, he was still defending Planned Parenthood.	0
767	RUBIO	He says he's not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel.	0
768	RUBIO	These are concerning things.	0
769	RUBIO	And so, yes, I have a doubt about whether Donald Trump, if he becomes president, will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia.	0
770	HEWITT	Mr. Trump?	0
771	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
772	TRUMP	Well, let -- let me just say -- let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia.	0
773	TRUMP	I thought he was terrific.	0
774	TRUMP	And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat.	0
775	TRUMP	Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative -- more importantly, he was a great president.	0
776	TRUMP	A great president.	0
777	TRUMP	As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life.	0
778	TRUMP	I'm totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood.	0
779	TRUMP	But millions and millions of women -- cervical cancer, breast cancer -- are helped by Planned Parenthood.	0
780	TRUMP	So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly.	0
781	TRUMP	And I wouldn't fund it.	0
782	TRUMP	I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent.	0
783	TRUMP	I don't know what percentage it is.	0
784	TRUMP	They say it's 3 percent.	0
785	TRUMP	But I would defund it, because I'm pro-life.	0
786	TRUMP	But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.	0
787	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
788	HEWITT	Governor Kasich, back to religious liberty.	0
789	HEWITT	You've been a little bit less emphatic.	0
790	HEWITT	You've said, same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker, sell them a cupcake.	0
791	HEWITT	Can we trust you as much on religious liberty as the rest of these people?	0
792	KASICH	Well, you know, of course.	0
793	KASICH	I mean, if -- look, I was involved in just being a pioneer in a new church.	0
794	KASICH	Religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in.	0
795	KASICH	No question and no doubt about it.	0
796	KASICH	Now, in regard to same-sex marriage, I don't favor it.	0
797	KASICH	I've always favored traditional marriage, but, look, the court has ruled and I've moved on.	0
798	KASICH	And what I've said, Hugh, is that, look, where does it end?	0
799	KASICH	If you're in the business of selling things, if you're not going to sell to somebody you don't agree with, OK, today I'm not going to sell to somebody who's gay, and tomorrow maybe I won't sell to somebody who's divorced.	0
800	KASICH	I mean, if you're in the business of commerce, conduct commerce.	0
801	KASICH	That's my view.	0
802	KASICH	And if you don't agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them when they leave and hope they change their behavior.	0
803	KASICH	But when it comes to the religious institutions, they are in inviolate in my mind, and I would fight for those religious institutions.	0
804	KASICH	And look, I've appointed over a hundred judges as governor.	0
805	KASICH	I even appointed adjudge to the Ohio Supreme Court.	0
806	KASICH	And you know what they are?	0
807	KASICH	They're conservatives.	0
808	KASICH	Go check it out.	0
809	KASICH	They are conservatives.	0
810	KASICH	They don't make the law.	0
811	KASICH	They interpret the law.	0
812	KASICH	That's all they do.	0
813	KASICH	And they stick by the Constitution.	0
814	KASICH	So I will do that.	0
815	KASICH	But let's just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that.	0
816	KASICH	I think my position is clear.	0
817	HEWITT	Dr. Carson, let me wrap it up with you.	0
818	HEWITT	Are their positions clear?	0
819	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
820	HEWITT	Are the positions you've heard clear about the First Amendment and the first freedom?	0
821	CARSON	Well, first of all, let me just add my praise to Justice Scalia.	0
822	CARSON	I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago.	0
823	CARSON	A tremendous wit and intellect.	0
824	CARSON	As far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights.	0
825	CARSON	And it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else.	0
826	CARSON	But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody get extra rights.	0
827	CARSON	So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it.	0
828	CARSON	That's unfair.	0
829	CARSON	And this is the responsibility of Congress to come back and correct what the Supreme Court has done.	0
830	CARSON	That's why we have divided government.	0
831	CARSON	And we're going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way, or we will lose our religious freedom.	0
832	CARSON	And as president, I would go through and I would look at what a person's life has been.	0
833	CARSON	What have they done in the past?	0
834	CARSON	What kind of judgments have they made?	0
835	CARSON	What kind of associations do they have?	0
836	CARSON	That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.	0
837	CARSON	The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.	0
838	BLITZER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.	0
839	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
840	BLITZER	All of you want to repeal and replace Obamacare, so let's talk about your plans, specific plans to replace it.	0
841	BLITZER	I want to bring in our chief political correspondent, Dana Bash.	0
842	BASH	Senator Rubio, you said yesterday, right here in Houston, that Mr. Trump thinks part of Obamacare is pretty good.	0
843	BASH	So, he says he is going to repeal Obamacare.	0
844	BASH	Are you saying that you're worried he won't?	0
845	RUBIO	The individual mandate.	0
846	RUBIO	He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which I don't believe that should be part of it.	0
847	RUBIO	That should not remain there.	0
848	RUBIO	I think here's what we need to replace it with.	0
849	RUBIO	We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again.	0
850	RUBIO	If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.	0
851	RUBIO	Otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.	0
852	RUBIO	And if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage.	0
853	RUBIO	And that, I think, is a much better approach than Obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy.	0
854	RUBIO	It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time.	0
855	RUBIO	It is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law.	0
856	RUBIO	And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.	0
857	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
858	BASH	Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio just said that you support the individual mandate.	0
859	BASH	Would you respond?	0
860	TRUMP	I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare.	0
861	TRUMP	We're going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when I'm referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre- existing conditions.	0
862	TRUMP	I think we need it.	0
863	TRUMP	I think it's a modern age.	0
864	TRUMP	And I think we have to have it.	0
865	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
866	BASH	OK, so let's talk about pre-existing conditions.	0
867	BASH	What the insurance companies say is that the only way that they can cover people is to have a mandate requiring everybody purchase health insurance.	0
868	BASH	Are they wrong?	0
869	TRUMP	I think they're wrong 100 percent.	0
870	TRUMP	What we need -- look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians.	0
871	TRUMP	The insurance companies get what they want.	0
872	TRUMP	We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition.	0
873	TRUMP	We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window.	0
874	TRUMP	The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests.	0
875	TRUMP	They got -- I'm not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, they're part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness.	0
876	TRUMP	And, actually, the Governor too, let's just talk about these too, OK?	0
877	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
878	TRUMP	Because I don't think the Governor had too much to do with this.	0
879	TRUMP	But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there's great competition.	0
880	TRUMP	The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.	0
881	TRUMP	I'm self-funding my campaign.	1
882	TRUMP	I'm the only one in either party self-funding my campaign.	1
883	TRUMP	I'm going to do what's right.	0
884	TRUMP	We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there's serious, serious competition.	0
885	BASH	But, Mr. Trump...	0
886	TRUMP	... And, you're going to see -- excuse me.	0
887	TRUMP	You're going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay.	0
888	TRUMP	Right now they're making a fortune.	0
889	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
890	BASH	But, just to be specific here, what you're saying is getting rid of the barriers between states, that is going to solve the problem...	0
891	TRUMP	That's going to solve the problem.	0
892	TRUMP	And, the insurance companies aren't going to say that, they want to keep it.	0
893	TRUMP	They want to say -- they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is.	0
894	TRUMP	I know the insurance companies, they're friends of mine.	0
895	TRUMP	The top guys, they're friends of mine.	0
896	TRUMP	I shouldn't tell you guys, you'll say it's terrible, I have a conflict of interest.	0
897	TRUMP	They're friends of mine, there's some right in the audience.	0
898	TRUMP	One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling.	0
899	TRUMP	He's not laughing so much anymore.	0
900	TRUMP	Hi.	0

902	TRUMP	Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune.	0
903	TRUMP	Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing.	0
904	TRUMP	Get rid of Obamacare, we'll come up with new plans.	0
905	TRUMP	But, we should keep preexisting conditions.	0
906	RUBIO	Dana, I was mentioned in his response, so if I may about the insurance companies...	0
907	BASH	... Go ahead.	0
908	RUBIO	You may not be aware of this, Donald, because you don't follow this stuff very closely, but here's what happened.	0
909	RUBIO	When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare.	0
910	RUBIO	All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.	0
911	RUBIO	And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund.	0
912	RUBIO	The insurance companies are not in favor of me, they hate that.	0
913	RUBIO	They're suing that now to get that bailout money put back in.	0
914	RUBIO	Here's what you didn't hear in that answer, and this is important guys, this is an important thing.	0
915	RUBIO	What is your plan?	0
916	RUBIO	I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means.	0
917	RUBIO	This is not a game where you draw maps...	0
918	TRUMP	... And, you don't know what it means...	0
919	RUBIO	... What is your plan, Mr. Trump?	0
920	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
921	RUBIO	What is your plan on healthcare?	0
922	TRUMP	You don't know.	0
923	BASH	(inaudible)	0
924	TRUMP	The biggest problem...	0
925	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
926	RUBIO	... What's your plan...	0
927	TRUMP	The biggest problem, I'll have you know...	0
928	RUBIO	... What's your plan...	0
929	TRUMP	... You know, I watched him meltdown two weeks ago with Chris Christie.	0
930	TRUMP	I got to tell you, the biggest problem he's got is he really doesn't know about the lines.	0
931	TRUMP	The biggest thing we've got, and the reason we've got no competition, is because we have lines around the state, and you have essentially....	0
932	RUBIO	... We already mentioned that (inaudible) plan, I know what that is, but what else is part of your plan...	0
933	TRUMP	... You don't know much...	0
934	RUBIO	So, you're only thing is to get rid of the lines around the states.	0
935	RUBIO	What else is part of your healthcare plan...	0
936	TRUMP	The lines around the states...	0
937	RUBIO	... That's your only plan...	0
938	TRUMP	... and, it was almost done -- not now...	0
939	RUBIO	... Alright, (inaudible)...	0
940	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
941	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
942	RUBIO	... His plan.	0
943	RUBIO	That was the plan...	0
944	TRUMP	... You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition.	0
945	TRUMP	So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you'll have many.	0
946	TRUMP	They'll compete, and it'll be a beautiful thing.	0
947	RUBIO	Alright...	0
948	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
949	RUBIO	So, that's the only part of the plan?	0
950	RUBIO	Just the lines?	0
951	BASH	(inaudible)	0
952	TRUMP	The nice part of the plan -- you'll have many different plans.	0
953	TRUMP	You'll have competition, you'll have so many different plans.	0
954	RUBIO	Now he's repeating himself.	0
955	TRUMP	No, no, no.	0

962	TRUMP	(inaudible) I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago...	0
963	RUBIO	I just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago...	0
964	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
965	TRUMP	I watched him meltdown on the stage like that, I've never seen it in anybody...	0
966	BASH	... Let's stay focused on the subject...	0
967	TRUMP	I thought he came out of the swimming pool...	0
968	RUBIO	I see him repeat himself every night, he says five things, everyone's dumb, he's gonna make America great again...	0
969	BASH	Senator Rubio...	0
970	RUBIO	... We're going to win, win win, he's winning in the polls...	0
971	BASH	Senator Rubio, please.	0
972	RUBIO	... And the lines around the state.	0
973	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
974	RUBIO	... Every night.	0
975	BASH	Senator Rubio.	0
976	SYSTEM	(CHEERING)	0
977	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	I tell the truth, I tell the truth.	0
978	BASH	Senator Rubio, you will have time to respond if you would just let Mr. Trump respond to what you've just posed to him...	0
979	RUBIO	... Yeah, he's going to give us his plan now, right?	0
980	RUBIO	OK...	0
981	BASH	If you could talk a little bit more about your plan.	0
982	BASH	I know you talked about...	0
983	TRUMP	... We're going to have many different plans because...	0
984	BASH	... Can you be a little specific...	0
985	TRUMP	... competition...	0
986	RUBIO	He's done it again.	0
987	SYSTEM	(CHEERING)	0
988	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
989	TRUMP	There is going to be competition among all of the states, and the insurance companies.	0
990	RUBIO	They're going to have many, many different plans.	0
991	BASH	Is there anything else you would like to add to that...	0
992	TRUMP	No, there's nothing to add.	0
993	SYSTEM	(CHEERING)	0
994	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
995	TRUMP	What is to add?	0
996	BASH	Thank you.	0
997	BASH	Thank you both.	0
998	RUBIO	Alright.	0
999	BASH	Governor Kasich, you've said it is, quote, "Un American to deny someone health insurance if they have a preexisting condition."	0
1000	BASH	Would you leave the individual mandate in place requiring all Americans to purchase insurance?	0
1001	KASICH	No, I wouldn't.	0
1002	KASICH	And -- but that doesn't matter when it comes to the issue of preexisting conditions.	0
1003	KASICH	You don't want any American to lose their house, everything they've saved, because they get sick.	0
1004	KASICH	Now, I think it is more complicated than what we've heard here tonight.	0
1005	KASICH	We're actually running significant health reform in my state.	0
1006	KASICH	I would repeal Obamacare for a variety of reasons.	0
1007	KASICH	I would take some of the federal resources, combine it with the freed-up Medicaid program, which I would send back to the states, and cover the people who are currently the working poor because we don't want to have tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance.	0
1008	KASICH	And then we're driving towards total transparency.	0
1009	KASICH	If any of you here ever get a hospital bill, it's easier to interpret the Dead Sea scrolls than to understand your hospital bill.	0
1010	KASICH	The fact is what we need is transparency with hospitals and with the providers.	0
1011	KASICH	And I'll tell you what we will do.	0
1012	KASICH	We are actually going to make payments to physicians and to hospitals who actually deliver healthcare with great quality at low prices.	0
1013	KASICH	We actually are going to make the market work.	0
1014	BASH	Governor, let me just go back to the original question about the individual mandate.	0
1015	BASH	In 1994 when you were in Congress, you proposed a plan requiring an individual mandate.	0
1016	BASH	So what changed?	0
1017	KASICH	Well, Dana, the Heritage Foundation had this position as well.	0
1018	KASICH	And when I look at it, I don't think it's tenable.	0
1019	KASICH	And we don't need to do that.	0
1020	KASICH	Again, I'm telling you that we are going to -- we have a proposal, a plan that we're enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you're providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint -- some charge high, some charge low.	0
1021	KASICH	If you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess.	0
1022	KASICH	That is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare.	0
1023	KASICH	Because if you think about your own deductibles today, they're going higher, higher and higher.	0
1024	KASICH	And you know what?	0
1025	KASICH	At some point, people can't afford it.	0
1026	KASICH	Our plan will work.	0
1027	KASICH	It uses the market.	0
1028	KASICH	It uses transparency.	0
1029	KASICH	It gets the patient in the middle.	0
1030	KASICH	And guess what?	0
1031	KASICH	We're actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country.	0
1032	KASICH	And if this will go -- this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what's going on.	0
1033	KASICH	We will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in America and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition.	0
1034	KASICH	We don't want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, Dana.	0
1035	KASICH	So that's really what we're doing.	0
1036	KASICH	This is not a theory.	0
1037	KASICH	This is what we are actually doing in our state.	0
1038	KASICH	We will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives.	0
1039	KASICH	If our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what?	0
1040	KASICH	They will get a financial reward.	0
1041	KASICH	Our primary care physicians need help.	0
1042	KASICH	They need support.	0
1043	KASICH	We're losing them.	0
1044	KASICH	This will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.	0
1045	BASH	Governor Kasich, thank you.	0
1046	KASICH	Thank you.	0
1047	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1048	BASH	Dr. Carson, you have dealt with the sickest of patients.	0
1049	BASH	You support covering preexisting conditions.	0
1050	BASH	How would you change Obamacare, but maintain that coverage?	0
1051	CARSON	Well, first of all, healthcare is not a right.	0
1052	CARSON	But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that.	0
1053	CARSON	We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.	0
1054	CARSON	I propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats.	0
1055	CARSON	And we give it to everybody from birth until death.	0
1056	CARSON	They can pass it on when they die.	0
1057	CARSON	We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with.	0
1058	CARSON	We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family.	0
1059	CARSON	So dad's $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle.	0
1060	CARSON	And it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man.	0
1061	CARSON	It gives you enormous flexibility.	0
1062	CARSON	And also, you know, if Uncle Joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody's going to hide his cigarettes because they're all interested in what's going on there.	0
1063	CARSON	Also, the -- your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare.	0
1064	CARSON	So, it's like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered.	0
1065	CARSON	One costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year.	0
1066	CARSON	You can buy the $1,500 one.	0
1067	CARSON	That will take care of 75 percent of the people.	0
1068	CARSON	The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now?	0
1069	CARSON	Medicaid.	0
1070	CARSON	What's the Medicaid budget?	0
1071	CARSON	Almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which I hope we get a chance to talk about.	0
1072	CARSON	But do the math.	0
1073	CARSON	Over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all -- they will have a lot more flexibility.	0
1074	CARSON	What could you buy with that?	0
1075	CARSON	A concierge practice.	0
1076	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
1077	CARSON	And you could still have thousands of dollars left over.	0
1078	CARSON	And let me just finish, because I don't get to talk that much.	0
1079	CARSON	And, you know, let's...	0
1080	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1081	CARSON	... you can have the money that's left over to buy your catastrophic insurance.	0
1082	CARSON	But most importantly, we give them a menu, just like we do in Medicare Part C, and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care, but drug care and everything else.	0
1083	CARSON	It will be such a good program that nobody will want Obamacare after that, and that's probably the best way do it, although if anybody still did, I would still de-fund it.	0
1084	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
1085	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1086	BLITZER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.	0
1087	BLITZER	Let's talk about the economy.	0
1088	BLITZER	Let's talk about...	0
1089	CRUZ	Wolf, Wolf, Wolf.	0
1090	CRUZ	Does everyone get to address Obamacare but me?	0
1091	BLITZER	I want to move on, but there'll be plenty of opportunities for you to address...	0
1092	CRUZ	It's kind of an issue I have a long history with.	0
1093	BLITZER	I know you do.	0
1094	BLITZER	And -- all right, go ahead.	0
1095	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1096	CRUZ	Thank you, Wolf.	0
1097	KASICH	How do you -- how do you get that extra time, Cruz?	0
1098	KASICH	You're very good at...	0
1099	CRUZ	You know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements.	0
1100	CRUZ	On Planned Parenthood, he thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful.	0
1101	CRUZ	I would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations.	0
1102	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1103	CRUZ	On Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons.	0
1104	CRUZ	I want to end it because it goes too far, it's killed millions of jobs, and it's hurting people's health care.	1
1105	CRUZ	Donald wants to end it because he says it doesn't go nearly far enough.	0
1106	CRUZ	And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.	0
1107	CRUZ	What he's said is government should pay for everyone's health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don't support socialized health care, you're heartless.	0
1108	CRUZ	Now, liberal Democrats have been saying that for years.	0
1109	CRUZ	Now let me tell you if you're a small business owner, Donald Trump's socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare, and if you're elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on earth where it's been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you don't get that hip replacement, you don't get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care.	0
1110	CRUZ	I'll tell you this.	0
1111	CRUZ	As president...	0
1112	BLITZER	Senator...	0
1113	CRUZ	I will repeal every word of Obamacare.	0
1114	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1115	BLITZER	Thank you, thank you.	0
1116	BLITZER	Mr. Trump?	0
1117	TRUMP	I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand.	0
1118	TRUMP	He goes around saying oh, he wants it.	0
1119	TRUMP	I do not want socialized medicine.	0
1120	TRUMP	I do agree with him that it's going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy.	0
1121	TRUMP	In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what's going on.	0
1122	TRUMP	That's why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn't work, number two, premium.	0
1123	TRUMP	You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more.	0
1124	TRUMP	We have to get rid of Obamacare.	0
1125	TRUMP	It is going to destroy our economy completely.	0
1126	TRUMP	Our economy is not doing well.	0
1127	TRUMP	It is going to destroy our economy greatly.	0
1128	TRUMP	And on that, I agree.	0
1129	CRUZ	Donald, true or false, you've said the government should pay for everyone's health care.	0
1130	TRUMP	That's false.	0
1131	CRUZ	You've never said that?	0
1132	TRUMP	No, I said it worked in a couple of countries...	0
1133	CRUZ	But you've never stood on this debate stage and says it works great in Canada and Scotland and we should do it here.	0
1134	TRUMP	No, I did not.	0
1135	TRUMP	No I did not.	0
1136	CRUZ	Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don't support socialized health care, you have no heart.	0
1137	TRUMP	Correct.	0
1138	TRUMP	I will not let people die on the streets if I'm president.	0
1139	CRUZ	Have you said you're a liberal on health care?	0
1140	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
1141	TRUMP	Let me talk.	0
1142	TRUMP	If people...	0
1143	CRUZ	Talk away.	0
1144	CRUZ	Explain your plan, please.	0
1145	TRUMP	If people -- my plan is very simple.	0
1146	TRUMP	I will not -- we're going to have private -- we are going to have health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I'm president.	0
1147	TRUMP	You may let it and you may be fine with it...	0
1148	CRUZ	So does the government pay for everyone's health care?	0
1149	TRUMP	I'm not fine with it.	0
1150	TRUMP	We are going to take those people...	0
1151	CRUZ	Yes or no.	0
1152	CRUZ	Just answer the question.	0
1153	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
1154	TRUMP	We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals.	0
1155	TRUMP	We're going to make great deals on it, but we're not going to let them die in the streets.	0
1156	CRUZ	Who pays for it?	0
1157	RUBIO	Well, can I just clarify something?	0
1158	BLITZER	Gentleman, please.	0
1159	RUBIO	Wolf, no.	0
1160	RUBIO	I want to clarify something.	0
1161	BLITZER	Gentlemen please.	0
1162	BLITZER	I want to move on.	0
1163	RUBIO	This is a Republican debate, right?	0
1164	RUBIO	Because that attack about letting people die in the streets...	0
1165	BLITZER	I want to talk about the economy.	0
1166	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1167	BLITZER	Gentleman, gentleman.	0
1168	BLITZER	All of you have agreed -- Senator Cruz...	0
1169	TRUMP	You know what?	0
1170	TRUMP	Call it what you want.	0
1171	CRUZ	It's a yes or no.	0
1172	TRUMP	Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.	0
1173	BLITZER	All of you have agreed -- all of you have agreed to the rules.	0
1174	BLITZER	I want to move on.	0
1175	BLITZER	We're talking about the economy right now.	0
1176	BLITZER	Mr. Trump, you want to cut taxes more than President Ronald Reagan did, more than President George W. Bush did.	0
1177	BLITZER	The Independent Tax Foundation says the cost to the country of your proposal would be about $10 trillion, and that takes into account the economic growth that would emerge from your proposed tax cuts.	0
1178	BLITZER	How would you cut $10 trillion over 10 years, but make sure the country isn't saddled with even more debt?	0
1179	TRUMP	Because the country will become a dynamic economy.	0
1180	TRUMP	We'll be dynamic again.	0
1181	TRUMP	If you look at what's going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world.	1
1182	TRUMP	We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax.	1
1183	TRUMP	We have the highest taxes in the world.	1
1184	TRUMP	It's shutting off our economy.	0
1185	TRUMP	It's shutting off our country.	0
1186	TRUMP	We have trillions of dollars outside that we can't get in.	0
1187	TRUMP	Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great.	0
1188	TRUMP	We will have a dynamic economy again.	0
1189	BLITZER	What specific cuts will you make to pay for that tax cut?	0
1190	TRUMP	We're going to make many cuts in business.	0
1191	TRUMP	We're getting rid of -- we're going to get rid of so many different things.	0
1192	TRUMP	Department of Education -- Common Core is out.	0
1193	TRUMP	We're going local.	0
1194	TRUMP	Have to go local.	0
1195	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1196	TRUMP	Environmental protection -- we waste all of this money.	0
1197	TRUMP	We're going to bring that back to the states.	0
1198	TRUMP	And we're going to have other (inaudible) many things.	0
1199	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1200	TRUMP	We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget, and we will be dynamic again.	0
1201	BLITZER	Mr. Trump -- Mr. Trump.	0
1202	BLITZER	If you eliminate completely the Department of Education, as you have proposed, that's about $68 billion.	0
1203	BLITZER	If you eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency, that's about $8 billion.	0
1204	BLITZER	That's about $76 billion for those two agencies.	0
1205	BLITZER	The current deficit this year is $544 billion.	0
1206	BLITZER	Where are you going to come up with the money?	0
1207	TRUMP	Waste, fraud and abuse all over the place.	0
1208	TRUMP	Waste, fraud and abuse.	0
1209	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1210	TRUMP	You look at what's happening with Social Security, you look -- look at what's happening with every agency -- waste, fraud and abuse.	0
1211	TRUMP	We will cut so much, your head will spin.	0
1212	BLITZER	Governor Kasich.	0
1213	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1214	BLITZER	When you were in Congress, you were chairman of the Budget Committee.	0
1215	BLITZER	You helped craft the last balanced budget the United States had.	0
1216	BLITZER	Can Mr. Trump's plan work?	0
1217	KASICH	Well, I think it takes three things, Wolf.	0
1218	KASICH	And I've done it.	0
1219	KASICH	I mean, I -- we got the budget balanced.	0
1220	KASICH	We cut the capital gains tax.	0
1221	KASICH	You see, in order to get this economy moving again, you have to grow the economy, and you have to restrain the spending.	0
1222	KASICH	And when I was chairman, we cut that capital gains tax and we instituted a significant program to get to balance.	0
1223	KASICH	We had a balanced budget four years in a row, had to take on every interest group in Washington -- every single one of them -- and we paid down a half a trillion of the national debt.	0
1224	KASICH	And why do you do it?	0
1225	KASICH	Because you want job growth.	0
1226	KASICH	If you don't have regulatory reform, common-sense regulations, reasonable tax cuts, which I have, and a fiscal plan, you won't get there.	0
1227	KASICH	You will never be able to do it.	0
1228	KASICH	Now, I -- I inherited an an $8 billion hole in Ohio, I have common-sense regulations, I have tax cuts -- the biggest of any governor in the country -- and we have a fiscal plan.	0
1229	KASICH	And it's not all -- it's not always cutting.	0
1230	KASICH	It's innovating -- it's producing a better product at, frankly, a lower price.	0
1231	KASICH	Now we have a $2 billion surplus.	0
1232	KASICH	Our credit is strong, our pensions are strong.	0
1233	KASICH	And, look -- I've got a plan to take to Washington, and I will have it there in the first hundred days, and it will include shifting welfare, education, transportation, Medicaid and job training back to us, so we can begin, in the states, to be the laboratories of innovation.	0
1234	KASICH	I've done it -- I did it in Washington -- four years of balanced budgets.	0
1235	KASICH	No one could even believe it happened.	0
1236	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
1237	KASICH	I've done it in Ohio, we're growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity.	0
1238	KASICH	And I will go back to Washington and do it again for the American people.	0
1239	KASICH	I promise you that.	0
1240	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1241	KASICH	Within the first hundred days, we will have the plan to get this done.	0
1242	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
1243	BLITZER	Thank you, governor.	0
1244	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1245	BLITZER	Speaking of taxes...	0
1246	TRUMP	I just want to say -- and I'm a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot.	0
1247	KASICH	OK, let me -- let me -- let me just talk about that, because I know that -- that Donald believes the energy industry is important.	0
1248	KASICH	So do I.	0
1249	KASICH	But of the over 400,000 jobs that we've created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because it's early-stage.	1
1250	KASICH	See, what we've done in Ohio, and what a president needs to do, is to have a cabinet and a whole operation that's jobs-friendly.	0
1251	KASICH	We have diversified our economy.	0
1252	KASICH	We -- we do have energy, we have medical devices, we have financial services, we have I.T., we just got Amazon -- their Cloud computing in the Midwest.	0
1253	KASICH	You know why it's happening?	0
1254	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
1255	KASICH	Because we're balanced budgets, we're strong, we're job-friendly, we don't raise their taxes, and if we have a president that does that in America, we will get the economic growth, and that is what this country needs.	0
1256	KASICH	Jobs, jobs and jobs, period.	0
1257	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1258	BLITZER	Mr. Trump, yesterday, the last Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, called on you to release your back tax returns, and said, and I'm quoting him now, "there is good reason to believe there is a bombshell in them."	0
1259	BLITZER	Romney said either you're not as wealthy as you say you are, said maybe you haven't paid the kind of taxes we would expect you to pay, or you haven't been giving the money to veterans or disabled people.	0
1260	BLITZER	Are any of those accusations that he has leveled true?	0
1261	TRUMP	All right.	0
1262	TRUMP	First of all, let me just explain.	0
1263	TRUMP	I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form -- almost 100 pages.	0
1264	TRUMP	You don't learn anything about somebody's wealth with a tax return.	0
1265	TRUMP	You learn it from statements.	0
1266	TRUMP	I filed -- which shows that I'm worth over $10 billion.	0
1267	TRUMP	I built a great company with very little debt.	0
1268	TRUMP	People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down.	0
1269	TRUMP	And I filed it on time.	0
1270	TRUMP	I didn't ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to.	0
1271	TRUMP	So as far as that's concerned, I filed it.	0
1272	TRUMP	And that's where you find out what kind of a company.	0
1273	TRUMP	You don't learn anything from a tax return.	0
1274	TRUMP	I will say this.	0
1275	TRUMP	Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed.	0
1276	TRUMP	And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully.	0
1277	TRUMP	And Mitt Romney didn't file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election.	0
1278	TRUMP	And it cost him big league.	0
1279	TRUMP	As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I've been audited every year.	0
1280	TRUMP	Twelve years, or something like that.	0
1281	TRUMP	Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me.	0
1282	TRUMP	Nobody gets audited -- I have friends that are very wealthy people.	0
1283	TRUMP	They never get audited.	0
1284	TRUMP	I get audited every year.	0
1285	TRUMP	I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years, so I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously.	1
1286	TRUMP	And I think people would understand that.	0
1287	BLITZER	Hugh, go ahead.	0
1288	HEWITT	Mr. Trump.	0
1289	HEWITT	You told me...	0
1290	TRUMP	Are you going to ask anybody else that question?	0
1291	CARSON	Yes, amen, amen.	0
1292	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1293	TRUMP	Every single question comes to me?	0
1294	HEWITT	Mr. Trump...	0
1295	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1296	TRUMP	I know I'm here for the ratings, but it's a little bit ridiculous.	0
1297	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1298	HEWITT	Mr. Trump, a year ago you told me on my radio show, the audio and the transcript are out there on YouTube, that you would release your tax returns.	0
1299	TRUMP	True.	0
1300	HEWITT	Are you going back on your commitment?	0
1301	TRUMP	No, I'm not.	0
1302	TRUMP	First of all, very few people listen to your radio show.	0
1303	TRUMP	That's the good news.	0
1304	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1305	TRUMP	Let me just tell you, let me just -- which happens to be true.	0
1306	TRUMP	Check out the ratings.	0
1307	TRUMP	Look, let me just tell you something.	0
1308	TRUMP	Let me just tell you something.	0
1309	TRUMP	I want to release my tax returns but I can't release it while I'm under an audit.	0
1310	TRUMP	We're under a routine audit.	0
1311	TRUMP	I've had it for years, I get audited.	0
1312	TRUMP	And obviously if I'm being audited, I'm not going to release a return.	0
1313	TRUMP	As soon as the audit is done, I love it.	0
1314	HEWITT	So, Senator Rubio, Mitt Romney also called upon to you release your tax returns.	0
1315	HEWITT	Your campaign said last spring that you would release your returns that you had not previously released.	0
1316	HEWITT	And you said, coming out any day momentarily.	0
1317	HEWITT	When are we going to see your returns?	0
1318	RUBIO	Yes, tomorrow or Saturday, in fact, is our plan to release them.	0
1319	RUBIO	And there's nothing really that interesting in them.	0
1320	RUBIO	So I have no problem releasing them.	0
1321	RUBIO	And luckily I'm not being audited this year, or last year, for that matter.	0
1322	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1323	RUBIO	But this is my time.	0
1324	RUBIO	I want to go back to this question you asked about the debt.	0
1325	RUBIO	This is an important issue.	0
1326	RUBIO	It's a huge issue, OK?	0
1327	RUBIO	In less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt.	0
1328	RUBIO	That means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.	0
1329	RUBIO	You cannot balance our budget unless you deal with that 83 percent, which is why I've been repeatedly talking about since my time running for the Senate in Florida, where there are a lot of people like my mother that depend on Social Security and Medicare, on the need to save those programs, by reforming the way they work for future generations.	0
1330	RUBIO	And I think if we -- the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis.	0
1331	RUBIO	And, Wolf, you did not get an answer to your question.	0
1332	RUBIO	This debt issue is -- the next president of the United States will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt.	0
1333	RUBIO	It is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis.	0
1334	RUBIO	And we should not leave the stage here tonight without hearing a serious answer from every single one of us about how we are going to deal bring the national debt under control once and for all.	0
1335	HEWITT	Thank you, Senator Rubio.	0
1336	HEWITT	But I am...	0
1337	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1338	HEWITT	I'm being fair to all of the candidates.	0
1339	HEWITT	Senator Cruz, Tuesday is five days away.	0
1340	HEWITT	Why haven't voters seen your 2012, 2013, and 2014 returns?	0
1341	CRUZ	So, I've released five years of tax returns already.	0
1342	CRUZ	We will have two more years available tomorrow.	0
1343	CRUZ	And I would note that this question really goes -- you know, Donald says he's being audited.	0
1344	CRUZ	Well, I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns.	0
1345	CRUZ	If he has said something that was false and that an audit is going to find was fraudulent, the voters need to know.	0
1346	CRUZ	And listen, people across this country, we recognize our country is in crisis.	0
1347	CRUZ	The most important question is how do we win the general election in November, 2016.	0
1348	CRUZ	And roughly 65 percent of Republicans think Donald is not the right candidate to go against Hillary Clinton.	0
1349	CRUZ	Now, part of the reason in the last 10 polls...	0
1350	TRUMP	Eighty-five percent say you, big difference.	0
1351	CRUZ	... RealClearPolitics he has lost to Hillary on eight of them.	1
1352	CRUZ	In the last 10 polls on RealClearPolitics, I either tied or beat Hillary.	1
1353	CRUZ	And this is an example.	0
1354	CRUZ	You know, the mainstream media is laying off Donald now.	0
1355	CRUZ	They're going to pick apart his taxes.	0
1356	CRUZ	They're going to pick apart his business deals.	0
1357	CRUZ	And let's take, for example, one of Hillary's great vulnerabilities, the corruption at the Clinton Foundation, the fact that she had CEOs and foreign companies giving her money while she was secretary of state.	0
1358	CRUZ	The next Republican nominee needs to be able to make that case against Hillary.	0
1359	CRUZ	And if Donald tried to did it, Hillary would turn to Donald and say, "but gosh, Donald, you gave $100,000 to the Clinton foundation. I even went to your wedding."	0
1360	CRUZ	He can't prosecute the case against Hillary, and we can't risk another four years of these failed Obama policies by nominating someone who loses to Hillary Clinton in November.	0
1361	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1362	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1363	TRUMP	So at the beginning, I said openly to everybody that I contribute to many, many politicians, both Republican and Democrat.	0
1364	TRUMP	And I have, over the years.	0
1365	TRUMP	I'm a businessman.	0
1366	TRUMP	I have, over the years.	0
1367	TRUMP	And I sort of have to laugh when Ted makes a big deal out of the fact that he's doing well in the polls.	0
1368	TRUMP	Well, I'm beating him in virtually every poll.	0
1369	TRUMP	I'm tied in Texas, by the way, which I shouldn't be.	0
1370	TRUMP	But I think I'll do very well.	0
1371	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1372	TRUMP	But a poll just came out -- a Bloomberg poll -- where I am beating him so badly that it's, like, embarrassing even for me to say I'm beating him that badly.	0
1373	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1374	TRUMP	And -- and here's the thing -- it was sort of funny -- 65 percent of the people don't like you -- I just got 36 percent of the vote, right?	0
1375	TRUMP	I just got 46 percent on another one.	0
1376	TRUMP	I got 38 percent...	0
1377	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
1378	TRUMP	... on another one.	0
1379	TRUMP	That means -- and he got 20 and 22, and he lost in South Carolina so badly -- that was going to be his stronghold.	0
1380	TRUMP	He said a year ago, "I can't lose South Carolina."	0
1381	TRUMP	I beat him in a landslide.	0
1382	TRUMP	Last week in Nevada, I beat him in a landslide, and he sang (ph) about the polls.	0
1383	TRUMP	One other thing -- Hillary Clinton -- take a look at USA Today, take a look at the Q poll.	0
1384	TRUMP	I beat her, and I beat her badly.	1
1385	TRUMP	And I -- and I haven't even started at her.	0
1386	TRUMP	I only had one little interchange...	0
1387	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1388	TRUMP	I only had one little interchange, and that was...	0
1389	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
1390	TRUMP	... four weeks ago, when she said I was sexist.	0
1391	TRUMP	And believe me, they had a rough weekend that weekend, between Bill and Hillary.	0
1392	TRUMP	They had a rough weekend.	0

1398	CRUZ	He -- he attacked me, Wolf.	0
1399	CRUZ	I get a response.	0
1400	BLITZER	I was about to say -- Senator Cruz, respond.	0
1401	CRUZ	Thank you.	0
1402	CRUZ	Thank -- thank -- thank you very much.	0
1403	CRUZ	You know, it's interesting -- Donald went -- went on -- on an extended tirade about the polls, but he didn't respond to any of the substance.	0
1404	CRUZ	He has yet to say -- he can release past year's tax returns.	0
1405	CRUZ	He can do it tomorrow.	0
1406	CRUZ	He doesn't want to do it, because presumably there's something in there...	0
1407	TRUMP	Nothing.	0
1408	CRUZ	... that is bad.	0
1409	CRUZ	If there's nothing, release them tomorrow.	0
1410	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1411	CRUZ	They're already prepared.	0
1412	CRUZ	The only reason he's not releasing them...	0
1413	TRUMP	You -- you don't...	0
1414	CRUZ	... is because he's afraid that he will get hit.	0
1415	TRUMP	I'm not afraid (inaudible).	0
1416	CRUZ	You know, Marco made reference earlier to the litigation against Trump University.	0
1417	CRUZ	It's a fraud case.	0
1418	CRUZ	His lawyers have scheduled the trial for July.	0
1419	CRUZ	I want you to think about, if this man is the nominee, having the Republican nominee...	0
1420	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
1421	CRUZ	... on the stand in court, being cross-examined about whether he committed fraud.	0
1422	CRUZ	You don't think the mainstream media will go crazy on that?	0
1423	CRUZ	And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times, who agreed with her on foreign policy, who agrees with Bernie Sanders on health care, who agreed with Barack Obama on the Wall Street bailout?	0
1424	BLITZER	All right (ph)...	0
1425	CRUZ	If -- we've got to win this election, and we can't do it with a candidate who agrees with Hillary Clinton and can't take it to her and beat her on the debate stage and at the polls.	0
1426	BLITZER	Mr. Trump.	0
1427	BLITZER	Mr, -- hold on.	0
1428	BLITZER	Mr. Trump -- Mr. Trump...	0
1429	TRUMP	... first of all, he's talking about the polls.	0
1430	TRUMP	I'm beating him awfully badly in the polls.	0
1431	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1432	CRUZ	But you're not beating Hillary.	0
1433	CRUZ	You're not beating Hillary.	0
1434	TRUMP	Well, then, if I can't -- if -- hey, if I can't beat her, you're really going to get killed, aren't you?	0
1435	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1436	TRUMP	So -- so let me ask you this, because you're really getting beaten badly.	0
1437	TRUMP	I know you're embarrassed -- I know you're embarrassed, but keep fighting -- keep swinging, man (ph).	0
1438	TRUMP	Swing for the fences.	0
1439	TRUMP	Let me just tell you -- let me just tell you, the Trump University case is a civil case.	0
1440	TRUMP	Not a -- it's a civil case.	0
1441	TRUMP	It's a case where people want to try and get -- it's a case that is nonsense.	0
1442	TRUMP	It's something I could have settled many times.	0
1443	TRUMP	I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don't want to do it out of principle.	0
1444	TRUMP	The people that took the course all signed -- most -- many -- many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.	0
1445	TRUMP	As -- and believe me, I'll win that case.	0
1446	TRUMP	That's an easy case.	0
1447	TRUMP	Civil case.	0
1448	TRUMP	Number two, as far as the taxes are concerned, I'm being audited.	0
1449	TRUMP	It's a very routine audit, and it's very unfair, because I've been audited for, I think, over 12 years.	0
1450	TRUMP	Every year, because of the size of my company, which is very, very large, I'm being audited -- which is a very large company.	0
1451	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
1452	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
1453	TRUMP	I'm being audited 12 years in a row, at least.	0
1454	TRUMP	Now, until that audit's done, and I don't think anybody would blame me, I'm not giving it...	0
1455	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1456	CRUZ	... the years you're not being audited?	0
1457	CRUZ	Will you release those years?	0
1458	BLITZER	Gentlemen, gentlemen, thank you.	0
1459	TRUMP	(inaudible) audited for those years.	0
1460	CRUZ	Which years?	0
1461	CRUZ	Which years are you being audited?	0
1462	BLITZER	Gentlemen...	0
1463	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1464	BLITZER	... we actually have rules -- we're trying to obey these rules that all of you agreed.	0
1465	BLITZER	We're going to take a quick break.	0
1466	BLITZER	We have a lot more -- many more critically important issues to discuss.	0
1467	BLITZER	Our coverage of this tenth Republican presidential debate from the University of Houston continues in a moment.	0
1468	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1469	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
1470	BLITZER	Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here at the University of Houston.	0
1471	BLITZER	Gentlemen, I want to turn our attention right now to key issues involving foreign policy and national security.	0
1472	BLITZER	And Mr. Trump, I'll begin with you.	0
1473	TRUMP	Shocking.	0
1474	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1475	BLITZER	You said this about the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians -- I'm quoting you now: "Let me be sort of a neutral guy. I don't want to say whose fault it is, I don't think it helps."	0
1476	TRUMP	Right.	0
1477	BLITZER	Here's the question.	0
1478	BLITZER	How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America's closest ally in the Middle East?	0
1479	TRUMP	Well, first of all, I don't think they do under President Obama because I think he's treated Israel horribly, all right?	0
1480	TRUMP	I think he's treated Israel horribly.	0
1481	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1482	TRUMP	I was the grand marshall down 5th Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel.	0
1483	TRUMP	I've received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.	0
1484	TRUMP	As president, however, there's nothing that I would rather do to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors generally.	0
1485	TRUMP	And I think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy.	0
1486	TRUMP	Now, I may not be successful in doing it.	0
1487	TRUMP	It's probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind.	0
1488	TRUMP	OK?	0
1489	TRUMP	But it doesn't help if I start saying, "I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage."	0
1490	TRUMP	But it doesn't do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors.	0
1491	TRUMP	And I can't do that as well -- as a negotiator, I cannot do that as well if I'm taking big, big sides.	0
1492	TRUMP	With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.	0
1493	BLITZER	Senator Cruz?	0
1494	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1495	CRUZ	Well, this is another area on which Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton and on which I disagree with them both strongly.	0
1496	CRUZ	Both Donald and Hillary Clinton want to be neutral, to use Donald's word, between Israel and the Palestinians.	0
1497	CRUZ	Let me be clear.	0
1498	CRUZ	If I'm president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel.	0
1499	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1500	CRUZ	And the notion of neutrality is based upon the left buying into this moral relativism that is often pitched in the media.	0
1501	CRUZ	Listen, it is not equivalent.	0
1502	CRUZ	When you have terrorist strapping dynamite around their chest, exploding and murdering innocent women and children, they are not equivalent to the IDF officers protecting Israel.	0
1503	CRUZ	And I will not pretend that they are.	0
1504	CRUZ	Just today, Iran announced they're going to pay $7,000 to each suicide bomber.	0
1505	CRUZ	And I would note, missing from Donald's answer was anything he has done in his nearly 70 years of living defending Israel.	0
1506	CRUZ	I have over and over again led the fight to defend Israel, to fight for Israel.	0
1507	CRUZ	And this -- if you want to know who will stand with Israel, we ought to start with who has stood with Israel when the heat was on.	0
1508	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1509	BLITZER	Mr. Trump?	0
1510	TRUMP	Well, I can only say -- look, I can only say I've been a big contributor to Israel over the years.	0
1511	TRUMP	I've received many, many awards from Israel, as I've said before.	0
1512	TRUMP	I have a great relationship with Israel.	0
1513	TRUMP	And I'm going to keep it that way.	0
1514	TRUMP	And if I could bring peace, that would be a fantastic thing.	0
1515	TRUMP	It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.	0
1516	BLITZER	Governor Kasich, I want you to weigh in.	0
1517	KASICH	Well, I mean, well, I was in Congress for 18 years on the Defense Committee.	0
1518	KASICH	And then, you know, after 9/11, the secretary of defense called me in to help out with some things.	0
1519	KASICH	And I've been a supporter of Israel -- a strong supporter of Israel longer than anybody on this stage.	0
1520	KASICH	I didn't give as much money as Donald gave, but I've been standing with the Israelis for a very long time.	0
1521	KASICH	And frankly, I think the problem we have in foreign policy right now, Wolf, is that we are not certain with who we stand with.	0
1522	KASICH	Our allies are not sure what to make of us, and our enemies are moving.	0
1523	KASICH	And one -- are moving because they're not sure what we will do.	0
1524	KASICH	It's a very interesting development here within the 24 hours.	0
1525	KASICH	We said to the South Koreans that we would give them the high altitude defense system.	0
1526	KASICH	It really rattled the Chinese, and for the first time since we took positive action, the Chinese are beginning to take action against North Korea.	0
1527	KASICH	When we stand firm and we let the world know who we're with, who we stand for, and we bring our allies together, that is the road forward.	0

1530	BLITZER	We're going to get to North Korea in a moment.	0
1531	BLITZER	But Senator Rubio, what's wrong with the U.S. being an honest broker in a negotiation, as Mr. Trump is proposing?	0
1532	RUBIO	Because -- and I don't know if Donald realizes this.	0
1533	RUBIO	I'm sure it's not his intent perhaps.	0
1534	RUBIO	But the position you've taken is an anti-Israel position.	0
1535	RUBIO	And here's why.	0
1536	RUBIO	Because you cannot be an honest broker in a dispute between two sides in which one of the sides is constantly acting in bad faith.	0
1537	RUBIO	The Palestinian Authority has walked away from multiple efforts to make peace, very generous offers from the Israels.	0
1538	RUBIO	Instead, here's what the Palestinians do.	0
1539	RUBIO	They teach their four- year-old children that killing Jews is a glorious thing.	0
1540	RUBIO	Here's what Hamas does.	0
1541	RUBIO	They launch rockets and terrorist attacks again Israel on an ongoing basis.	0
1542	RUBIO	The bottom line is, a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, given the current makeup of the Palestinians, is not possible.	0
1543	RUBIO	And so the next president of the United States needs to be someone like me who will stand firmly on the side of Israel.	0
1544	RUBIO	I'm not -- I'm not going to sit here and say, "Oh, I'm not on either side."	0
1545	RUBIO	I will be on a side.	0
1546	RUBIO	I will be on Israel's side every single day because they are the only pro-American, free enterprise democracy in the entire Middle East.	0
1547	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1548	BLITZER	Mr. Trump?	0
1549	TRUMP	I'm a negotiator.	0
1550	TRUMP	I've done very well over the years through negotiation.	0
1551	TRUMP	It's very important that we do that.	0
1552	TRUMP	In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator.	0
1553	TRUMP	I watched him melt down and I'll tell you, it was one of the saddest things I've ever seen.	0
1554	TRUMP	He's not going down -- excuse me...	0
1555	RUBIO	He thinks a Palestinian is a real estate deal.	0
1556	TRUMP	... wait a minute, and these people may even be tougher than Chris Christie.	0
1557	TRUMP	OK?	0
1558	RUBIO	The Palestinians are not a real estate deal, Donald.	0
1559	TRUMP	OK, no, no, no -- a deal is a deal.	0
1560	TRUMP	Let me tell you that.	0
1561	TRUMP	I learned a long time ago.	0
1562	RUBIO	A deal is not a deal when you're dealing with terrorists.	0
1563	RUBIO	Have you ever negotiated with terrorists?	0
1564	TRUMP	You are not a negotiator.	0
1565	TRUMP	You are not a negotiator.	0
1566	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1567	TRUMP	And, with your thinking, you will never bring peace.	0
1568	TRUMP	You will never bring peace...	0
1569	RUBIO	... Donald, might be able to (inaudible) Palestinians and Arabs, but it's not a real estate deal...	0
1570	TRUMP	Excuse me, I want to be able to bring peace...	0
1571	BLITZER	Senator.	0
1572	TRUMP	He will never be able to do it.	0
1573	TRUMP	I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this.	0
1574	TRUMP	Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.	0
1575	BLITZER	Let's move on to talk about North Korea.	0
1576	BLITZER	You raised it, Governor Kasich.	0
1577	BLITZER	The threat posed by North Korea to the United States and its allies, the commander of American forces in South Korea said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would use a weapon of mass destruction if he thought his regime was being threatened.	0
1578	BLITZER	You have said the United States should start examining a strategy of regime change in North Korea.	0
1579	BLITZER	Let's be clear.	0
1580	BLITZER	Are you talking about getting rid of Kim Jong Un?	0
1581	KASICH	When you talk about regime change, Wolf, it means regime change.	0
1582	KASICH	That's what it means.	0
1583	KASICH	Even though there's so much chaos in North Korea right now, there's a lot of reports of uncertainty, and instability in that government.	0
1584	KASICH	But, look, here's what I think we ought to do -- like, immediately.	0
1585	KASICH	And, we've been kicking the can down the road on this for, I don't know, 15 years.	0
1586	KASICH	We should be intercepting the ships that are leaving North Korea so they're not selling this material, or this technology, or giving it to someone else.	0
1587	KASICH	Secondly, the same goes with the aircraft.	0
1588	KASICH	Thirdly, we need to slap even tougher sanctions on North Korea because we really don't have the toughest sanctions on North Korea.	0
1589	KASICH	We ought to talk about arming South Korea with ballistic missile technology.	0
1590	KASICH	And, of course, also Japan with ballistic missile technology.	0
1591	KASICH	Because we're now starting to take a firm position.	0
1592	KASICH	We have the attention of the Chinese.	0
1593	KASICH	The Chinese are the best way to calm that regime down and get them in a position of where they back off.	0
1594	KASICH	But, when I say regime change, I don't have to talk exactly what that means.	0
1595	KASICH	Look, I've been involved in national security for a long time.	0
1596	KASICH	You don't have to spell everything out, but what I'm telling you is you look for any means you can to be able to solve that problem in North Korea, and in the meantime put the pressure on the Chinese.	0
1597	KASICH	And, what we're doing is beginning to work against them.	0
1598	KASICH	They are the key to being able to settle this situation.	0
1599	BLITZER	I just want to be precise, Governor Kasich, this is critically important.	0
1600	BLITZER	There are a million North Korean troops North of the DMZ...	0
1601	KASICH	I'm very well aware of that.	0
1602	BLITZER	A million South Korean troops, 28,000 U.S. troops along the DMZ, right in between.	0
1603	BLITZER	Would you risk war for a regime change?	0
1604	KASICH	Wolf, again, it would depend exactly what, you know, what was happening.	0
1605	KASICH	What the situation was.	0
1606	KASICH	But, if there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea and create stability?	0
1607	KASICH	Because, I'll tell you, you keep kicking the can down the road we're going to face this sooner or later.	0
1608	KASICH	But, in the meantime, I'm also aware of the fact that there's 10 million people living in Seoul.	0
1609	KASICH	So, you don't just run around making charges.	0
1610	KASICH	I have put it on the table that I would leave to see regime change in North Korea.	0
1611	KASICH	Now, perhaps the Chinese can actually accomplish that with this man who is now currently the leader, but the fact is we have to bring everything to bear.	0
1612	KASICH	We have to be firm, and we've got to unite those people in that part of the world to stand firmly against North Korea, and make sure we have the ballistic...	0
1613	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGING)	0
1614	KASICH	... ballistic missile technology to defend ourselves.	0
1615	BLITZER	Mr. Trump.	0
1616	TRUMP	One thing I'd like to add to what the Governor's saying, I think that we are now in a position -- are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it's going to be $21 trillion dollars.	0
1617	TRUMP	We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea.	0
1618	TRUMP	You order televisions, you order almost anything, you're getting it from these countries.	0
1619	TRUMP	Whether it's a Mercedes-Benz, or whether it's an air conditioning unit.	0
1620	TRUMP	They're coming out of these countries.	0
1621	TRUMP	They are making a fortune.	0
1622	TRUMP	Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia.	0
1623	TRUMP	Before the oil went down, now they're making less, but they're making plenty.	0
1624	TRUMP	They were making $1 billion dollars a day.	0
1625	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGING)	0
1626	TRUMP	We defend all of these countries for peanuts.	0
1627	TRUMP	You talk about budgets.	0
1628	TRUMP	We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries.	0
1629	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1630	KASICH	Hey, Wolf, Wolf...	0
1631	BLITZER	Dr. Carson.	0
1632	KASICH	Hey, Wolf, let me just say this because he mentioned this.	0
1633	KASICH	Look, we're all in agreement that the Japanese need to do more.	0
1634	KASICH	We're all in agreement that the Europeans need to do more, but I hate to just tell everybody we are the leader of the world and we should put the pressure on them to do their job.	0
1635	KASICH	There is no question about it.	0
1636	KASICH	But, at the same time, we also have to rebuild the military.	0
1637	KASICH	Look, I have a balanced budget plan that cuts taxes, reforms regulations, but also builds the military, puts a $100 billion dollars more in defense.	0
1638	KASICH	We need to rebuild our defenses,	0
1639	KASICH	But, I must also tell you, a long time reformer of the Pentagon, we must reform that building.	0
1640	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGING)	0
1641	KASICH	We can't have a weapon system take 22 and a half years.	0
1642	KASICH	We have 800,000 bureaucrats working for DOD, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting...	0
1643	BLITZER	Thank you...	0
1644	KASICH	... these resources into strengthening the military.	0
1645	KASICH	So, we can do it all...	0
1646	BLITZER	Dr. Carson, how would you deal with North Korea?	0
1647	CARSON	OK. Well first of all, people say that I whine a lot because I don't get time.	0
1648	CARSON	I'm going to whine because I didn't get asked about taxes, I didn't get asked about Israel.	0
1649	CARSON	Hugh, you said you're going to be fair to everybody, you didn't ask me about taxes.	0
1650	CARSON	I had something to say about that.	0
1651	CARSON	Now...	0
1652	BLITZER	Go ahead.	0
1653	BLITZER	This is your moment.	0
1654	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1655	CARSON	OK. We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong.	0
1656	CARSON	You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings.	0
1657	CARSON	And then they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the whole year.	0
1658	CARSON	And they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the next year and the next year.	0
1659	CARSON	They didn't find anything and they won't find anything because I'm a very honest person.	0
1660	CARSON	But he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them.	0
1661	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1662	CARSON	And as far as Israel is concerned, you know, when I was there several months ago, I talked to a lot of people.	0
1663	CARSON	I couldn't find a single one who didn't think that we had turned our backs on Israel.	0
1664	CARSON	You know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a Judeo Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel.	0
1665	CARSON	It doesn't mean that we can't be fair to other people.	0
1666	CARSON	We can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it's like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child.	0
1667	CARSON	And now, as far as North Korea is concerned, you know, Kim Jung Un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength.	0
1668	CARSON	And I think we have to present strength to him.	0
1669	CARSON	We should be encouraging the alliance with Japan and South Korea.	0
1670	CARSON	We should be encouraging the placement of the THAAD, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, that seems to disturb not only the North Koreans but the Chinese as well.	0
1671	CARSON	And we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and I think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities.	0
1672	CARSON	We need to be able to defend ourselves.	0
1673	CARSON	And lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.	0
1674	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1675	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
1676	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
1677	BLITZER	We're going to continue with national security.	0
1678	BLITZER	Go ahead, Hugh.	0
1679	HEWITT	Thank you, Wolf.	0
1680	HEWITT	Mr. Trump, we are less than 24 hours away from a ceasefire in Syria that has been brokered between the U.S. and Russia.	0
1681	HEWITT	Do you support this ceasefire?	0
1682	TRUMP	I really don't because it not working and the countries aren't agreeing to it and the rebels aren't agreeing and Syria is not agreeing.	0
1683	TRUMP	So It's a meaningless ceasefire.	0
1684	TRUMP	I love the idea of a ceasefire.	0
1685	TRUMP	I love the idea of -- with a total cessation.	0
1686	TRUMP	But it's not working, as you know very well.	0
1687	TRUMP	It's not working.	0
1688	TRUMP	If -- we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it.	0
1689	TRUMP	So I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it.	0
1690	HEWITT	Senator Cruz, your opinion on the ceasefire.	0
1691	CRUZ	Well look.	0
1692	CRUZ	We're certainly hopeful that the violence will cease, but there's reason to be highly skeptical.	0
1693	CRUZ	Russia has enhanced its position because of Obama's weakness in the Middle East, weakness in Syria.	0
1694	CRUZ	And you know, as we're headed to November, we need no nominate a Republican candidate that can lay out a clear difference with both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy.	0
1695	CRUZ	One of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.	0
1696	CRUZ	So for example, in Libya, both of them agreed with the Obama/Clinton policy of toppling the government in Libya.	1
1697	CRUZ	That was a disaster.	0
1698	CRUZ	It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.	0
1699	CRUZ	Another example is John Kerry.	0
1700	CRUZ	John Kerry -- Senator Rubio voted to confirm John Kerry as secretary of State.	0
1701	CRUZ	I voted against him.	0
1702	CRUZ	And Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check.	0
1703	CRUZ	And John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel secretary of State this country has ever seen.	0
1704	CRUZ	His diplomacy has been a disaster.	0
1705	CRUZ	And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, we're not in a strong position to win the general election.	0
1706	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1707	HEWITT	A response, Mr. Trump, then Mr. Rubio.	0
1708	TRUMP	Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest.	0
1709	TRUMP	I think they both liked me very much.	0
1710	TRUMP	But the fact is that ...	0
1711	CRUZ	But you called for Bush to be impeached.	0
1712	TRUMP	Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that's concerned.	0
1713	TRUMP	You know it and so do I.	0
1714	CRUZ	But you gave him a check and called for him to be impeached.	0
1715	TRUMP	Be honest.	0
1716	TRUMP	Be honest.	0
1717	TRUMP	No, this was before.	0
1718	TRUMP	The check came early.	0
1719	TRUMP	But let me just tell you, Syria, he's saying that I was in favor of Syria.	0
1720	TRUMP	He said I was in favor of Libya?	0
1721	TRUMP	I never discussed that subject.	1
1722	TRUMP	I was in favor of Libya?	0
1723	TRUMP	We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.	0
1724	TRUMP	If these politicians went to the beach and didn't do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we'd be -- at least they killed terrorists, all right?	0
1725	TRUMP	And I'm not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don't know what we're getting.	0
1726	TRUMP	You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil.	0
1727	TRUMP	As we speak, it's a total mess.	0
1728	TRUMP	We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war.	0
1729	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1730	HEWITT	Senator Rubio.	0
1731	RUBIO	Yes, a couple of points.	0
1732	RUBIO	Number one, on the Libya situation, we didn't topple Gadhafi, the Libyan people toppled Gadhafi.	0
1733	RUBIO	The only choice before America that this president had to make is, does it happen quickly or does it take a long time?	0
1734	RUBIO	And I argued if it takes a long time, you're going to have rebel forces emerge like these radical Islamists to take advantage of the vacuum.	0
1735	RUBIO	And that's what happened.	0
1736	RUBIO	That's where the term "lead from behind" came.	0
1737	RUBIO	And that's the foreign policy that apparently Senator Cruz appears to agree with.	0
1738	RUBIO	On John Kerry, yes, you know why, because every day John Kerry wasn't appointed was another day Hillary Clinton was still in charge of the State Department.	0
1739	RUBIO	And she was absolutely horrible.	0
1740	RUBIO	I couldn't imagine that they were going to find somebody even worse than her, but this president never ceases to amaze.	0
1741	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1742	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1743	RUBIO	And the last point I would make on South Korea, now this is important, because we're asking to be commander-in-chief.	0
1744	RUBIO	Donald is asking to be commander-in-chief.	0
1745	RUBIO	And he's saying these guys need to do more.	0
1746	RUBIO	South Korea contributes $800 million a year to that effort.	0
1747	RUBIO	And Japan contributes as well.	0
1748	RUBIO	And here's why our commitment to that regional security is so critical, Donald, because if we walk away from them, both Japan and South Korea will become nuclear weapons powers.	0
1749	RUBIO	They can do that very quickly.	0
1750	RUBIO	And that's what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we can't walk away from our Asia-Pacific defense status.	0
1751	HEWITT	Mr. Trump.	0
1752	TRUMP	I never said walk away.	0
1753	TRUMP	I wouldn't want to walk away.	0
1754	TRUMP	I want them to pay us much more money.	0
1755	TRUMP	We cannot afford to subsidize...	0
1756	RUBIO	How much?	0
1757	TRUMP	A lot.	0
1758	TRUMP	I'll negotiate a lot more money than you'll ever get.	0
1759	TRUMP	As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.	0
1760	TRUMP	It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it's a disaster for Israel.	0
1761	TRUMP	I'm no fan of John Kerry.	0
1762	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1763	BLITZER	Hold on, hold on, Governor.	0
1764	BLITZER	Senator Cruz.	0
1765	CRUZ	You know, it's interesting, Donald just said that he never came out in favor of toppling Gadhafi in Libya.	0
1766	CRUZ	Well, he stated that in an interview that will be on our Web site, tedcruz.org.	0
1767	CRUZ	You can see and hear the exact words from Donald's mouth.	0
1768	CRUZ	And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, but I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.	0
1769	CRUZ	With regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerry's foreign policy has been a disaster for decades.	0
1770	CRUZ	That's why I voted against him when he came up.	0
1771	CRUZ	And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W. Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.	0
1772	CRUZ	And I'll give one more example on Israel.	0
1773	CRUZ	When the Obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?	0
1774	CRUZ	The next day Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London.	0
1775	CRUZ	Together the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into Israel.	0
1776	CRUZ	During that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald?	0
1777	CRUZ	If this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-Israel politicians from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry for four decades?	0
1778	CRUZ	If you care about Israel, you don't write checks to politicians who are undermining Israel.	0
1779	CRUZ	Instead you stand and support the national security of America and the alliance with Israel.	0

1811	KASICH	There's something -- I want to -- I want to point out something here today that is -- it's so critically important -- about how the Obama administration has really done such a ridiculous, feckless job here in foreign policy.	0
1812	KASICH	First of all, we should have been supporting the rebels long ago.	0
1813	KASICH	They could have taken Assad out, and because we did nothing, the Russians are in, and they're sitting in the catbird seat.	0
1814	KASICH	We should have been helping them.	0
1815	KASICH	I'm thankful that the aid trucks are finally getting into Syria.	0
1816	KASICH	But the fact is, had we had acted, we would have solved that problem.	0
1817	KASICH	Now, let's talk about Libya.	0
1818	KASICH	Libya didn't go down because there was some people revolution.	0
1819	KASICH	Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and all these other people convinced the president to undermine Gadhafi.	0
1820	KASICH	They undermined him, and now they have created a cesspool in Libya.	0
1821	KASICH	And let me just say to you -- we have ISIS beginning get -- get a foothold in Libya.	0
1822	KASICH	We're gonna have to deal with it.	0
1823	KASICH	There are not many major cities in Libya.	0
1824	KASICH	They're on the coast, which -- mostly, it's desert, but it's a problem.	0
1825	KASICH	Then we have ISIS in -- in Syria, and we have ISIS in Iraq.	0
1826	KASICH	Because this administration has not had a strong and firm foreign policy, we are going to inherit -- one of us here is going to inherit a total mess...	0
1827	BLITZER	All right...	0
1828	KASICH	... and we're going to have to work our way out of it, including...	0
1829	BLITZER	Let's continue.	0
1830	KASICH	... the need to arm the Ukrainians.	0
1831	KASICH	They have been ignored, and we need to help them as well...	0
1832	BLITZER	Let us continue.	0
1833	KASICH	... and assert ourselves as America.	0
1834	BLITZER	Let's continue the questioning on ISIS.	0

1844	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1845	BLITZER	Go ahead and respond.	0
1846	CRUZ	You know, what we're seeing with Donald is actually the pattern of Washington -- the pattern of Washington deal makers, which is they make promises, they break their words, and then when anyone calls them on it, they call you a liar.	0
1847	CRUZ	And so that's Donald's pattern over and over again.	0
1848	CRUZ	He said, for example, seven months ago -- this is Donald speaking, quote -- "I, Donald Trump, was a member of the establishment."	0
1849	CRUZ	There's a reason Harry Reid thinks he's the best Republican up here.	0
1850	CRUZ	There's a reason Jimmy Carter said he would support Donald Trump over me, because he said Donald Trump is malleable, he has no fixed set of beliefs...	0
1851	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
1852	CRUZ	... whereas Ted Cruz is not malleable.	0
1853	CRUZ	And every time anyone points at Donald's actual record...	0
1854	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
1855	CRUZ	... what he said on national television, Donald yells "liar."	0
1856	CRUZ	Let me tell you something -- falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie...	0
1857	BLITZER	Go ahead, Mr. Trump.	0
1858	CRUZ	... and it's something Donald does daily.	0
1859	BLITZER	Go ahead, Mr. Trump.	0

1863	TRUMP	I watched what this man did to Dr. Ben Carson, who I respect, in Iowa, where he said that Ben Carson is out of the race -- he has left Iowa and he's out of the race.	0
1864	TRUMP	And I thought it was disgraceful.	0
1865	TRUMP	And got a lot of votes because of that -- a lot of votes.	0
1866	TRUMP	Took them away from Ben Carson.	0
1867	TRUMP	I watched that.	0
1868	TRUMP	Probably took them away from me, too.	0
1869	TRUMP	But I watched it.	0
1870	TRUMP	I also watched where he did a forum that looked like it came right out of a government agency, and it said on top, "Voter Violation," and then it graded you...	0
1871	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
1872	TRUMP	... and it scared the hell out of people, and it said the only way you clear up the violation, essentially, is to go and vote for Ted Cruz.	0
1873	TRUMP	I watched that fraudulent document, and I said it's the worst thing I've ever seen in politics.	0
1874	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0

1951	CARSON	My name was mentioned.	0
1952	BLITZER	I want to talk -- I want to talk about ISIS right now, and the federal government -- how much best to keep Americans safe from ISIS.	0
1953	BLITZER	There's a huge battle underway right now between the tech giant Apple and the federal government.	0
1954	BLITZER	The federal government wants Apple to unlock the phone used by that San Bernardino terrorist to prevent future attacks.	0
1955	BLITZER	Apple has refused, saying it would compromise the security of all of its customers.	0
1956	BLITZER	And just this afternoon, they went to court to block the judge's order.	0
1957	BLITZER	Dana Bash, pick up the questioning.	0
1958	BASH	Senator Rubio, you say it's complicated, and that, quote, "Apple isn't necessarily wrong to refuse the court order."	0
1959	BASH	Why shouldn't investigators have everything at their disposal?	0
1960	RUBIO	No, in fact what I have said is the only thing -- the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago -- the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer.	0
1961	RUBIO	Apple initially came out saying, "We're being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device."	0
1962	RUBIO	That is not accurate.	0
1963	RUBIO	The only thing they're being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self- destruct mode that's in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was.	0
1964	RUBIO	And I think they should comply with that.	0
1965	RUBIO	If that's all they're asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption.	0
1966	BASH	So just to be clear, you did say on CNN a couple of weeks ago this is a complicated issue; Apple is not necessarily wrong here.	0
1967	RUBIO	Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device.	0
1968	BASH	But just to be clear -- just to be clear, if you are president, would you instruct your Justice Department to force Apple to comply or not?	0
1969	RUBIO	To comply with an order that says that they have to allow the FBI the opportunity to try to guess the password?	0
1970	BASH	Correct.	0
1971	RUBIO	Absolutely.	0
1972	RUBIO	That Apple phone didn't even belong to the killer.	0
1973	RUBIO	It belonged to the killer's employee (sic) who have agreed to allow him to try to do this.	0
1974	RUBIO	That is all they're asking them to do is to disable the self-destruct mode or the auto-erase mode on one phone in the entire world.	0
1975	RUBIO	But Apple doesn't want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.	0
1976	RUBIO	Well, let me tell you, their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States of America.	0
1977	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1978	BASH	Senator Cruz, Apple CEO Tim Cook says this would be bad for America.	0
1979	BASH	Where do you stand: national security or personal privacy?	0
1980	CRUZ	Well, as you know, at that same CNN forum, both Marco and I were asked this question.	0
1981	CRUZ	His answer, he was on both sides of the fence.	0
1982	CRUZ	He's now agreeing with me.	0
1983	CRUZ	And so I'm glad.	0
1984	CRUZ	What I said is yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order.	0
1985	CRUZ	Why?	0
1986	CRUZ	Because under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure is reasonable if it has judicial authorization and probable cause.	0
1987	CRUZ	In this instance, the order is not put a back door in everyone's cell phone.	0
1988	CRUZ	If that was the order, that order would be problematic because it would compromise security and safety for everyone.	0
1989	CRUZ	I would agree with Apple on that broad policy question.	0
1990	CRUZ	But on the question of unlocking this cell phone of a terrorist, we should enforce the court order and find out everyone that terrorist at San Bernardino talked to on the phone, texted with, e-mailed.	0
1991	CRUZ	And absolutely, Apple doesn't have a right to defy a valid court order in a terrorism investigation.	0
1992	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1993	BASH	Dr. Carson, Tim Cook, again, the CEO of Apple, says that this would be bad for America.	0
1994	BASH	What do you think?	0
1995	CARSON	I think allowing terrorist to get away with things is bad for America.	0
1996	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1997	CARSON	You know, we have the -- we have a Constitution.	0
1998	CARSON	We have a Fourth Amendment.	0
1999	CARSON	It guards us against illegal and unreasonable search and seizure.	0
2000	CARSON	But we have mechanisms in place with the judicial system that will allow us to gain material that is necessary to benefit the nation as a whole or the community as a whole.	0
2001	CARSON	And that's why we have FISA courts and things of that nature.	0
2002	CARSON	So absolutely, I would -- I would expect Apple to comply with the court order.	0
2003	CARSON	If they don't comply with that, you're encouraging chaos in our system.	0
2004	BASH	Mr. Trump...	0
2005	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
2006	KASICH	I want to weigh in on this please.	0
2007	KASICH	I want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and Apple.	0
2008	KASICH	You know what the problem is?	0
2009	KASICH	Where's the president been?	0
2010	KASICH	You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out.	0
2011	KASICH	You don't litigate this on the front page of the New York Times, where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here.	0
2012	KASICH	The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces.	0
2013	KASICH	And then you know what you do when you're the president?	0
2014	KASICH	You lock the door and you say you're not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans.	0
2015	KASICH	This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.	0
2016	KASICH	And I'll tell you, that's why you want a governor.	0
2017	KASICH	I do this all the time.	0
2018	KASICH	And we reach agreements all the time.	0
2019	KASICH	Because as an executive, you've got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper.	0
2020	CELESTE	Thank you, Governor.	0
2021	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
2022	KASICH	Thank you.	0
2023	CELESTE	Mr. Trump, you have been very vocal about securing the Mexican border, but ISIS has called upon its supporters to conduct attacks on our neighbor to the North, Canada.	0
2024	CELESTE	As a matter of fact, U.S. officials have warned that it is the Canadian border which is the most significant threat.	0
2025	CELESTE	You have said that you will not build a wall in Canada.	0
2026	CELESTE	When it comes to national security, and the threat of terrorism, why does Mexico need a wall, and Canada doesn't?	0
2027	CELESTE	Isn't that, like, closing the front door, and leaving the back door open?	0
2028	TRUMP	First of all, you're talking about a border that's many, many times longer.	1
2029	TRUMP	You're talking about a massive border.	0
2030	TRUMP	We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts -- you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire.	0
2031	TRUMP	You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in.	0
2032	TRUMP	And, you wouldn't think this beautiful place -- it's beautiful.	0
2033	TRUMP	With the trees and the roads, and the countryside.	0
2034	TRUMP	Their biggest problem is heroin, and it's such a shame to see it.	0
2035	TRUMP	They're pouring in from the Southern border, so I'm talking about great security.	0
2036	TRUMP	I'm talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and I'll build it on time, on budget.	0
2037	TRUMP	It'll be a very high wall, a great wall.	0
2038	TRUMP	It's going to be built, it's going to be built.	0
2039	TRUMP	It's going to be paid for by Canada, by the way -- maybe I'll get Canada to pay?	0
2040	TRUMP	Got to be paid for by Mexico.	0
2041	TRUMP	The problem with Canada, you're talking about a massively long piece.	1
2042	TRUMP	You're talking about a border that would be about four times longer.	1
2043	TRUMP	It would be very, very hard to do, and we -- it is not our biggest problem.	0
2044	TRUMP	I don't care what anyone says.	0
2045	TRUMP	It is not our big problem.	0
2046	TRUMP	Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it's the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in.	0
2047	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
2048	CELESTE	I want to talk to you, Senator Rubio, about Puerto Rico.	0
2049	CELESTE	As you know, Puerto Rico's in the midst of financial collapse, unable to pay it's debt of $72 billion dollars.	0
2050	CELESTE	Puerto Rico is asking for bankruptcy protection which would give Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans, which are U.S. citizens, you know that -- the tools to restructure the debt.	0
2051	CELESTE	That is the same debt the other 50 states have.	0
2052	CELESTE	You oppose granting Puerto Rico that bankruptcy protection.	0
2053	CELESTE	You say that it is only a last resort measure, but the government of Puerto Rico has said that bankruptcy is it's last resort.	0
2054	CELESTE	That that's where they are now.	0
2055	CELESTE	How do you explain this very strong stance to the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans that vote across the U.S. , and particularly in your state of Florida?	0
2056	RUBIO	Sure, because bankruptcy doesn't work unless you change the way you're operating, or you're going to be bankrupt again.	0
2057	RUBIO	And, the problem with Puerto Rico is it's economy is not growing.	0
2058	RUBIO	It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country.	0
2059	RUBIO	They're coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing, it's too expensive to do business there.	0
2060	RUBIO	The tax rate is too high.	0
2061	RUBIO	The government regulations are too extensive.	0
2062	RUBIO	This year alone, with all the problems they're having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next.	0
2063	RUBIO	So, I think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again.	0
2064	RUBIO	If the economy of Puerto Rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they've made to future generations to make payments.	0
2065	RUBIO	So, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they're asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland.	0
2066	RUBIO	They're United States citizens, they're obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a Puerto Rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust.	0
2067	RUBIO	And, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job.	0
2068	RUBIO	Their previous governor, Louis Fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that election to...	0
2069	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGING)	0

2081	BLITZER	Dr. Carson, we'll start with you.	0
2082	CARSON	Well first of all, I want people to think about what kind of leader do you want and what kind of person do you want your kids to emulate.	0
2083	CARSON	Think about that.	0
2084	CARSON	Secondly, several years ago, a movie was made about these hands.	0
2085	CARSON	These hands by the grace of God have saved many lives and healed many families.	0
2086	CARSON	And I'm asking you tonight, America, to join hands with me to heal, inspire and revive America.	0

2091	KASICH	Well, the last USA Today poll had me beating Hillary Clinton by 11 points, more than anybody on this stage.	0
2092	KASICH	Secondly, I hope you saw tonight that executive experience really matters.	0
2093	KASICH	It matters in terms of growing our economy, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, reforming regulations.	0
2094	KASICH	I've done it in Washington, I've done it in Ohio, and I can go back to Washington and do it again.	0
2095	KASICH	But I hope you also noticed tonight that I do have the foreign policy experience, not just a few years, but a lot of years in working with some of the great, great minds in this country to develop the expertise, the confidence, the firmness, the toughness and the ability to bring people together.	0
2096	KASICH	I hope you all think about giving me your vote.	0
2097	KASICH	I would appreciate it very much.	0

2105	RUBIO	It was just a few months ago there were 15 or 11 us on the stage and now it's narrowed and the votes are starting to count.	0
2106	RUBIO	And we have an incredible decision to make, not just about the direction of America, but the identity of our party and of the conservative movement.	0
2107	RUBIO	The time for games is over.	0
2108	RUBIO	I know you've had a lot of choices to make, but now it's time to narrow it down.	0
2109	RUBIO	And I'm asking you to get behind me, go on our Web site and join you our effort, marcorubio.com, so we can bring an end to this silliness, this looniness, and once again re-embrace all the things that made America and the Republican Party the bearer of the conservative movement in this country.	0
