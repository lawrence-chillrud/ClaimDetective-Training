158	TRUMP	Fake news.	0
159	TRUMP	Fake, fake news.	0
160	TRUMP	Fake news, folks.	0
161	TRUMP	A lot of fake.	0
162	TRUMP	No, the wall is way ahead of schedule in terms of where we are.	0
163	TRUMP	It’s under design, and you’re going to see some very good things happening.	0
164	TRUMP	But the border by itself right now is doing very well.	0
165	TRUMP	It’s becoming very strong.	0
166	TRUMP	General Kelly has done a great job — General Kelly.	0
167	TRUMP	My administration is also following through on our promise to secure, protect, and defend that border within our United States.	0
168	TRUMP	Our southern border will be protected always.	0
169	TRUMP	It will have the wall.	0
170	TRUMP	Drugs will stop pouring in and poisoning our youth, and that will happen very, very soon.	0
171	TRUMP	You’re already seeing what’s going on.	0

174	TRUMP	We’re not going to playing games.	0
175	TRUMP	Not going to be playing games.	0
176	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
177	TRUMP	Following my executive action — and don’t forget, we’ve only been here for like — what? — 50 days — we’ve already experienced an unprecedented 40-percent reduction in illegal immigration on our Southern border; 61 percent since Inauguration Day — 61 percent.	0
178	TRUMP	Think about it.	0
179	TRUMP	And now people are saying, we’re not going to go there anymore because we can’t get in.	0
180	TRUMP	So it’s going to get better and better.	0
181	TRUMP	We got to stop those drugs, though.	0
182	TRUMP	We got to stop those drugs.	0
183	TRUMP	During the campaign, as I traveled all across this country, I met with many American families whose loved ones were viciously and violently killed by illegal immigrants because our government refused to enforce our already existing laws.	0
184	TRUMP	These American victims were ignored by the media.	0
185	TRUMP	They were ignored by Washington.	0
186	TRUMP	But they were not ignored by me, and they’re not ignored by you, and they never will be ignored certainly any longer.	0
187	TRUMP	Not going to happen.	0
188	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
189	TRUMP	As we speak, we are finding the drug dealers, the robbers, thieves, gang members, killers and criminals preying on our citizens.	0
190	TRUMP	One by one — you’re reading about it, right?	0
191	TRUMP	They’re being thrown out of our country.	0
192	TRUMP	They’re being thrown into prisons.	0
193	TRUMP	And we will not let them back in.	0
194	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
195	TRUMP	We’re also working, night and day, to keep our nation safe from terrorism.	0
196	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
197	TRUMP	We have seen the devastation from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino — hundreds upon hundreds of people from outside our country have been convicted of terrorism-related offenses in the United States courts.	1
198	TRUMP	Right now we have investigations going on all over — hundreds of refugees are under federal investigation for terrorism and related reasons.	1
199	TRUMP	We have entire regions of the world destabilized by terrorism and ISIS.	0
200	TRUMP	For this reason, I issued an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from places where it cannot safely occur.	0
201	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
202	TRUMP	But let me give you the bad news.	0
203	TRUMP	We don’t like bad news, right?	0
204	TRUMP	I don’t want to hear — and I’ll turn it into good.	0
205	TRUMP	But let me give you the bad, the sad news.	0
206	TRUMP	Moments ago, I learned that a district judge in Hawaii — part of the much overturned 9th Circuit Court — and I have to be nice; otherwise I’ll get criticized for speaking poorly about our courts.	0
207	TRUMP	I’ll be criticized by these people, among the most dishonest people in the world — I will be criticized — I’ll be criticized by them for speaking harshly about our courts.	0
208	TRUMP	I would never want to do that.	0
209	TRUMP	A judge has just blocked our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries.	0
210	AUDIENCE	Booo —	0
211	TRUMP	The order he blocked was a watered-version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with.	0
212	TRUMP	This new order was tailored to the dictates of the 9th Circuit’s — in my opinion — flawed ruling.	0
213	TRUMP	This is, the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach.	0
214	TRUMP	The law and the Constitution give the President the power to suspend immigration when he deems — or she — or she.	0
215	TRUMP	Fortunately, it will not be Hillary she.	0
216	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
217	TRUMP	When he or she deems it to be in the national interest of our country.	0
218	TRUMP	So we have a lot of lawyers here.	0
219	TRUMP	We also have a lot of smart people here.	0
220	TRUMP	Let me read to you directly from the federal statute, 212F, of the immigration — and you know what I’m talking about, right?	0
221	TRUMP	Can I read this to you?	0
222	TRUMP	Listen to this.	0
223	TRUMP	Now, we’re all smart people.	0
224	TRUMP	We’re all good students — some are bad students, but even if you’re a bad student this is a real easy one, let me tell you.	0
225	TRUMP	Ready?	0
226	TRUMP	So here’s the statute — which they don’t even want to quote when they overrule it.	0
227	TRUMP	And it was put here for the security of our country.	0
228	TRUMP	And this goes beyond me, because there will be other Presidents, and we need this.	0
229	TRUMP	And sometimes we need it very badly for security — security of our country.	0
230	TRUMP	It says — now, listen how easy this is.	0
231	TRUMP	"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he" — see, it wasn’t politically correct, because it should say he or she.	0
232	TRUMP	You know, today they’d say that.	0
233	TRUMP	Actually, that’s the only mistake they made.	0
234	TRUMP	"as he shall deem necessary, suspending entry of all aliens, or any class of aliens, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or pose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deems to be appropriate."	0
235	TRUMP	In other words, if he thinks there’s danger out there, he or she — whoever is President — can say, I’m sorry, folks, not now, please.	0
236	TRUMP	We’ve got enough problems.	0
237	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
238	TRUMP	We’re talking about the safety of our nation, the safety and security of our people.	0
239	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
240	TRUMP	Now, I know you people aren’t skeptical people because nobody would be that way in Tennessee.	0
241	TRUMP	Right?	0
242	TRUMP	Nobody — not Tennessee.	0
243	TRUMP	You don’t think this was done by a judge for political reasons, do you?	0
244	TRUMP	No.	0
245	AUDIENCE	Booo —	0
246	TRUMP	THE PRESIDENT:	0
247	TRUMP	This ruling makes us look weak — which, by the way, we no longer are, believe me.	0
248	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
249	TRUMP	Just look at our borders.	0
250	TRUMP	We’re going to fight this terrible ruling.	0
251	TRUMP	We’re going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court.	0
252	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
253	TRUMP	We’re going to win.	0
254	TRUMP	We’re going to keep our citizens safe.	0
255	TRUMP	And regardless, we’re going to keep our citizens safe, believe me.	0
256	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
257	TRUMP	Even liberal Democratic lawyer, Alan Dershowitz —- good lawyer — just said that we would win this case before the Supreme Court of the United States.	0
258	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
259	TRUMP	Remember this, I wasn’t thrilled, but the lawyers all said, let’s tailor it.	0
260	TRUMP	This is a watered–down version of the first one.	0
261	TRUMP	This is a watered–down version.	0
262	TRUMP	And let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first one.	0
263	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
264	TRUMP	The danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear.	0
265	TRUMP	I was elected to change our broken and dangerous system and thinking in government that has weakened and endangered our country and left our people defenseless.	0
266	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
267	TRUMP	And I will not stop fighting for the safety of you and your families, believe me.	0
268	TRUMP	Not today, not ever.	0
269	TRUMP	We’re going to win it.	0
270	TRUMP	We’re going to win it.	0
271	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
272	TRUMP	We’re going to apply common sense.	0
273	TRUMP	We’re going to apply intelligence.	0
274	TRUMP	And we’re never quitting, and we’re never going away, and we’re never, ever giving up.	0
275	TRUMP	The best way to keep foreign terrorists — or, as some people would say in certain instances, radical Islamic terrorists — from attacking our country is to stop them from entering our country in the first place.	0
276	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
277	TRUMP	We’ll take it, but these are the problems we have.	0
278	TRUMP	People are screaming, break up the 9th Circuit.	0
279	TRUMP	And I’ll tell you what, that 9th Circuit — you have to see.	0
280	TRUMP	Take a look at how many times they have been overturned with their terrible decisions.	0
281	TRUMP	Take a look.	0
282	TRUMP	And this is what we have to live with.	0
283	TRUMP	Finally, I want to get to taxes.	0
284	TRUMP	I want to cut the hell out of taxes, but —	0
285	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
286	TRUMP	— but before I can do that — I would have loved to have put it first, I’ll be honest — there is one more very important thing that we have to do, and we are going to repeal and replace horrible, disastrous Obamacare.	0
287	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
288	TRUMP	If we leave Obamacare in place, millions and millions of people will be forced off their plans, and your senators just told me that in your state you’re down to practically no insurers.	0
289	TRUMP	You’re going to have nobody.	0
290	TRUMP	You’re going to have nobody.	0
291	TRUMP	And this is true all over.	0
292	TRUMP	The insurers are fleeing.	0
293	TRUMP	The insurers are fleeing.	0
294	TRUMP	It’s a catastrophic situation, and there’s nothing to compare anything to because Obamacare won’t be around for a year or two.	0
295	TRUMP	It’s gone.	0
296	TRUMP	So it’s not like, oh, gee, they have this.	0
297	TRUMP	Obamacare is gone.	0
298	TRUMP	Premiums will continue to soar double digits and even triple digits in many cases.	0
299	TRUMP	It will drain our budget and destroy our jobs.	0
300	TRUMP	Remember all of the broken promises?	0
301	TRUMP	You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.	0
302	TRUMP	Remember the wise guy — remember the wise guy that essentially said the American people — the so–called architect — the American people are stupid because they approved it?	0
303	TRUMP	We’re going to show them.	0
304	TRUMP	Those in Congress who made these promises have no credibility whatsoever on healthcare.	0
305	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
306	TRUMP	And remember this — remember this:  If we took, because there’s such divisiveness — and I’m not just talking now, with me.	0
307	TRUMP	There was with Obama.	0
308	TRUMP	There was with Bush.	0
309	TRUMP	The level of hatred and divisiveness with the politicians.	0
310	TRUMP	I remember years ago, I’d go to Washington — I was always very politically active — and Republicans and Democrats, they’d fight during the day and they go to dinner at night.	0
311	TRUMP	Today, there’s a level that nobody has seen before.	0
312	TRUMP	Just remember this:  If we submitted the Democrats’ plan, drawn everything perfect for the Democrats, we wouldn’t get one vote from the Democrats.	0
313	TRUMP	That’s the way it is.	0
314	TRUMP	That’s how much divisiveness and other things there are.	0
315	TRUMP	So it’s a problem.	0
316	TRUMP	But we’re going to get it by.	0
317	TRUMP	So, I’ve met with so many victims of Obamacare —- the people who have been so horribly hurt by this horrible legislation.	0
318	TRUMP	At the very core of Obamacare was a fatal flaw — the government forcing people to buy a government–approved product.	0
319	TRUMP	There are very few people — very few people.	0
320	AUDIENCE	Booo —	0
321	TRUMP	By the way — watch what happens.	0
322	TRUMP	Now you just booed Obamacare.	0
323	TRUMP	They will say, Trump got booed when he mentioned — they’re bad people, folks.	0
324	TRUMP	They’re bad people.	0
325	AUDIENCE	Booo —	0
326	TRUMP	Tonight, I’ll go home, I’ll turn on, I’ll say — listen, I’ll turn on that television.	0
327	TRUMP	My wife will say, darling, it’s too bad you got booed.	0
328	TRUMP	I said, I didn’t get booed.	0
329	TRUMP	This was a — I said, no, no, they were booing Obamacare.	0
330	TRUMP	Watch, a couple of them will actually do it, almost guaranteed.	0
331	TRUMP	But when we call them out, it makes it harder for them to do it.	0
332	TRUMP	So we’ll see.	0
333	TRUMP	It’s the fake, fake media.	0
334	TRUMP	We want Americans to be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our government.	0
335	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
336	TRUMP	The House has put forward a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare based on the principles I outlined in my joint address, but let me tell you, we’re going to arbitrate, we’re going to all get together and we’re going to get something done.	0
337	TRUMP	Remember this — if we didn’t do it the way we’re doing it, we need 60 votes so we have to get the Democrats involved.	0
338	TRUMP	They won’t vote, no matter what we do, they’re not going to vote.	0
