1	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
2	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
3	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
4	TRUMP	I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.	0
5	TRUMP	We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.	0
6	TRUMP	But it is really very sad as to what’s going on throughout the world with terror.	0
7	TRUMP	Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected.	0
8	TRUMP	Before we discuss the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin with an update on our tremendous — absolutely tremendous — economic progress since Election Day on November 8th.	1
9	TRUMP	The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly.	1
10	TRUMP	We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs.	1
11	TRUMP	I have just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.	1
12	TRUMP	It was a very, very successful trip, believe me.	0
13	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
14	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
15	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
16	TRUMP	In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations.	0
17	TRUMP	We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.	0
18	TRUMP	Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you see that, you see it all over — from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror.	0
19	TRUMP	Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren’t doing so much in the form of contribution.	0
20	TRUMP	One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for President –- whether it’s cutting job-killing regulations; appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice; putting in place tough new ethics rules; achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border; or bringing jobs, plants, and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.	0
21	TRUMP	And believe me, we’ve just begun.	0
22	TRUMP	The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so.	0
23	TRUMP	On these issues and so many more, we’re following through on our commitments.	0
24	TRUMP	And I don’t want anything to get in our way.	0
25	TRUMP	I am fighting every day for the great people of this country.	0
26	TRUMP	Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord —	0
27	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
28	TRUMP	— thank you, thank you — but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris Accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.	0
29	TRUMP	So we’re getting out.	0
30	TRUMP	But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.	0
31	TRUMP	And if we can, that’s great.	0
32	TRUMP	And if we can’t, that’s fine.	0
33	TRUMP	(APPLAUSE)	0
34	TRUMP	As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens.	0
35	TRUMP	The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers — who I love — and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.	1
36	TRUMP	Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.	1
37	TRUMP	This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune.	0
38	TRUMP	Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates.	1
39	TRUMP	This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs — not what we need — believe me, this is not what we need — including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely.	1
40	TRUMP	They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.	0
41	TRUMP	According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors:  paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal — and I happen to love the coal miners — down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent.	1
42	TRUMP	The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that.	1
43	TRUMP	Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.	0
44	TRUMP	As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States — which is what it does -– the world’s leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world’s leading polluters.	1
45	TRUMP	For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13.	1
46	TRUMP	They can do whatever they want for 13 years.	0
47	TRUMP	Not us.	0
48	TRUMP	India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.	0
49	TRUMP	There are many other examples.	0
50	TRUMP	But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.	0
51	TRUMP	Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.	1
52	TRUMP	We’re having a big opening in two weeks.	0
53	TRUMP	Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places.	0
54	TRUMP	A big opening of a brand-new mine.	0
55	TRUMP	It’s unheard of.	0
56	TRUMP	For many, many years, that hasn’t happened.	0
57	TRUMP	They asked me if I’d go.	0
58	TRUMP	I’m going to try.	0
59	TRUMP	China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.	1
60	TRUMP	So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.	1
61	TRUMP	India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.	0
62	TRUMP	Think of it:  India can double their coal production.	0
63	TRUMP	We’re supposed to get rid of ours.	0
64	TRUMP	Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.	0
65	TRUMP	In short, the agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.	0
66	TRUMP	This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.	0
67	TRUMP	The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement — they went wild; they were so happy — for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage.	0
68	TRUMP	A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.	0
69	TRUMP	We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.	0
70	TRUMP	We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.	0
71	TRUMP	Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation — it’s great wealth, it’s phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth — and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.	0
72	TRUMP	The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.	0
73	TRUMP	At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country —	0
74	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
75	TRUMP	— will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.	0
76	TRUMP	Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree — think of that; this much — Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100.	0
77	TRUMP	Tiny, tiny amount.	0
78	TRUMP	In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America — and this is an incredible statistic — would totally wipe out the gains from America’s expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes.	0
79	TRUMP	As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning:  "The reality is that withdrawing is in America’s economic interest and won’t matter much to the climate."	0
80	TRUMP	The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.	0
81	TRUMP	We’ll be the cleanest.	0
82	TRUMP	We’re going to have the cleanest air.	0
83	TRUMP	We’re going to have the cleanest water.	0
84	TRUMP	We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to lose our jobs.	0
85	TRUMP	We’re going to grow; we’re going to grow rapidly.	0
86	TRUMP	(APPLAUSE)	0
87	TRUMP	And I think you just read — it just came out minutes ago, the small business report — small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people.	0
88	TRUMP	One of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.	0
89	TRUMP	I’m willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers.	0
90	TRUMP	(APPLAUSE)	0
91	TRUMP	So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.	0
92	TRUMP	We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal.	0
93	TRUMP	And we’ll make it good, and we won’t be closing up our factories, and we won’t be losing our jobs.	0
94	TRUMP	And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that’s much better than the Paris Accord.	0
95	TRUMP	And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled.	0
96	TRUMP	But until we do that, we’re out of the agreement.	0
97	TRUMP	I will work to ensure that America remains the world’s leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.	0
98	TRUMP	No responsible leader can put the workers — and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.	0
99	TRUMP	The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement:  It’s to give their country an economic edge over the United States.	0
100	TRUMP	That’s not going to happen while I’m President.	0
101	TRUMP	I’m sorry.	0
102	TRUMP	(APPLAUSE)	0
103	TRUMP	My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection.	0
104	TRUMP	Our tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it’s doing very well.	0
105	TRUMP	I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.	0
106	TRUMP	The Republicans are working very, very hard.	0
107	TRUMP	We’d love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone.	0
108	TRUMP	But it’s going very well.	0
109	TRUMP	The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country’s expense.	0
110	TRUMP	They don’t put America first.	0
111	TRUMP	I do, and I always will.	0
112	TRUMP	(APPLAUSE)	0
113	TRUMP	The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.	0
114	TRUMP	You see what’s happening.	0
115	TRUMP	It’s pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.	0
116	TRUMP	At what point does America get demeaned?	0
117	TRUMP	At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?	0
118	TRUMP	We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.	0
119	TRUMP	We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore.	0
120	TRUMP	And they won’t be.	0
121	TRUMP	They won’t be.	0
122	TRUMP	I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.	0
123	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
124	TRUMP	I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America’s interests.	0
125	TRUMP	Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation.	0
126	TRUMP	Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.	0
127	TRUMP	The process has begun from day one.	0
128	TRUMP	But now we’re down to business.	0
129	TRUMP	Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America’s existing and massive foreign aid payments.	0
130	TRUMP	So we’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.	0
131	TRUMP	Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime.	0
132	TRUMP	The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion — nobody else is even close; most of them haven’t even paid anything — including funds raided out of America’s budget for the war against terrorism.	0
133	TRUMP	That’s where they came.	0
134	TRUMP	Believe me, they didn’t come from me.	0
135	TRUMP	They came just before I came into office.	0
136	TRUMP	Not good.	0
137	TRUMP	And not good the way they took the money.	0
138	TRUMP	In 2015, the United Nation’s departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as "peanuts," and stated that "the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog."	0
139	TRUMP	In 2015, the Green Climate Fund’s executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020.	0
140	TRUMP	And nobody even knows where the money is going to.	1
141	TRUMP	Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to?	1
142	TRUMP	Of course, the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.	0
143	TRUMP	America is $20 trillion in debt.	0
144	TRUMP	Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure.	0
145	TRUMP	Millions of our citizens are out of work.	0
146	TRUMP	And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.	0
147	TRUMP	So think of that.	0
148	TRUMP	There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well.	0
149	TRUMP	Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives.	0
150	TRUMP	Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty.	0
151	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
152	TRUMP	Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.	0
153	TRUMP	And I will.	0
154	TRUMP	Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America’s abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly.	0
155	TRUMP	It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal.	0
156	TRUMP	The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time.	0
157	TRUMP	In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point — as bad as it is — not an end point.	0
158	TRUMP	And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability.	1
159	TRUMP	Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.	1
160	TRUMP	As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people.	0
161	TRUMP	The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world.	0
162	TRUMP	It is time to exit the Paris Accord —	0
163	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
164	TRUMP	— and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.	0
165	TRUMP	It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania — along with many, many other locations within our great country — before Paris, France.	0
166	TRUMP	It is time to make America great again.	0
167	TRUMP	(APPLAUSE)	0
168	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
169	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
170	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
171	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
172	TRUMP	Very important.	0
173	TRUMP	I’d like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words.	0
