1	TRUMP	Thank you very much everybody.	0
2	TRUMP	We’ve had a great three days at the United Nations in New York.	0
3	TRUMP	And this is quite a gathering.	0
4	TRUMP	Wow.	0
5	TRUMP	It’s a lot of people.	0
6	TRUMP	A lot of media.	0
7	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
8	TRUMP	We’ve covered a great deal of territory.	0
9	TRUMP	Just left, as you know, Prime Minister Abe of Japan.	0
10	TRUMP	We’re starting trade talks with Japan.	0
11	TRUMP	They were not willing, for years, to talk trade, and now they’re willing to talk trade.	0
12	TRUMP	And I’m sure we’ll make a very good deal.	0
13	TRUMP	Just concluded, as you know — two days ago, signed a deal with South Korea — a trade deal.	0
14	TRUMP	A tremendous deal with South Korea.	0
15	TRUMP	It means a lot of business for our farmers.	0
16	TRUMP	We’re opening up for farmers.	0
17	TRUMP	We’re opening up for a lot of different groups.	0
18	TRUMP	We’re going to be able to sell much more than double the number of automobiles that we were allowed under a deal that was totally defective that was there before.	0
19	TRUMP	And so we’re very happy with that.	0
20	TRUMP	That deal is actually concluded.	0
21	TRUMP	We’re very well along the way with Mexico.	0
22	TRUMP	The relationship is very good.	0
23	TRUMP	And with Canada, we’ll see what happens.	0
24	TRUMP	They’re charging us 300-percent tariffs on dairy products.	0
25	TRUMP	We can’t have that.	0
26	TRUMP	We can’t have that.	0
27	TRUMP	With China, as you know, we put out an announcement today.	0
28	TRUMP	They would like to see me lose an election because they’ve never been challenged like this.	0
29	TRUMP	But I want to open up China to our farmers and to our industrialists and our companies.	0
30	TRUMP	And China is not open, but we’re open to them.	0
31	TRUMP	They charge us 25, 35, 55 percent for things, and we charge them nothing in terms of coming into the country.	0
32	TRUMP	Cars, they’re at 25 percent.	0
33	TRUMP	And we’re at 2 percent and 2.5 percent, and don’t even collect it.	0
34	TRUMP	But we collect it now.	0
35	TRUMP	So we’re doing very well in our situation with China on trade.	0
36	TRUMP	I have a great relationship with the President of China, President Xi.	0
37	TRUMP	But it’s got to be a two-way street.	0
38	TRUMP	It — for 25 years and longer, it was not.	0
39	TRUMP	And trillions and trillions of dollars was taken out of the United States for the benefit of China.	0
40	TRUMP	We just can’t have that.	0
41	TRUMP	We have to make it fair.	0
42	TRUMP	So we’re at $250 billion now, at 25 percent interest.	0
43	TRUMP	And a lot of money is coming into our coffers.	0
44	TRUMP	And it’s had no impact on our — absolutely, by the way, no impact on our economy, which I said it wouldn’t.	0
45	TRUMP	In fact, steel is like the hottest industry there is.	0
46	TRUMP	If you look at what happened with steel, we’re charging a 25 percent tariff for the dumpers.	0
47	TRUMP	They dump massive amounts of steel.	0
48	TRUMP	They want to put the steel companies out of business.	0
49	TRUMP	And after they’re out of business, they’ll come in and charge five times more than you ever thought possible.	0
50	TRUMP	And we need steel and we need aluminum.	0
51	TRUMP	And those industries are doing well.	0
52	TRUMP	But steel is incredible.	0
53	TRUMP	U.S. Steel is opening up a minimum of eight plants.	1
54	TRUMP	Nucor is opening up plants.	0
55	TRUMP	And these are big plants — $750 million and a billion dollar plants, in some cases.	0
56	TRUMP	So what’s happening with the steel industry is very exciting to me.	0
57	TRUMP	It’s being rebuilt overnight.	0
58	TRUMP	If you look at the miners in coal, if you look at energy, LNG — Japan just gave us some numbers that are incredible.	0
59	TRUMP	They’re doubling the amount that they are going to be buying for Japan.	0
60	TRUMP	They’re taking the LNG and they’re doubling it up.	0
61	TRUMP	I said, "You have to do me a favor. We don’t want these big deficits. You’re going to have to buy more"	0
62	TRUMP	They’re buying massive amounts of equipment and military equipment, and other countries are doing the same thing.	0
63	TRUMP	Because we have trade imbalances with almost everybody.	0
64	TRUMP	It’s a rare exception that we don’t.	0
65	TRUMP	So we are doing great as a country.	0
66	TRUMP	Unfortunately, they just raised interest rates a little bit because we are doing so well.	0
67	TRUMP	I’m not happy about that, because I know it’s going to be a question.	0
68	TRUMP	I am not happy about that.	0
69	TRUMP	I’d rather pay down debt or do other things, create more jobs.	0
70	TRUMP	So I’m worried about the fact that they seem to like raising interest rates.	0
71	TRUMP	We can do other things with the money.	0
72	TRUMP	And — but they raised them.	0
73	TRUMP	And they’re raising them because we’re doing so well.	0
74	TRUMP	You know, we’re doing much better than I had projected in terms of — when I was campaigning, I said we were going to do this and we’re doing much better than anybody ever thought possible.	0
75	TRUMP	And, I will say, if others got in, it would have been just the opposite because they were going to put restrictions on.	0
76	TRUMP	They were going to put regulations on.	0
77	TRUMP	They were going to choke the economy as it was already choking, but it would have been worse.	0
78	TRUMP	And they were going to raise your taxes.	0
79	TRUMP	That’s what they want to do now if they ever got control, which I don’t think they’ll have control for a long time.	0
80	TRUMP	So, with that being said, we’ll take some questions and — yes, please.	0
81	TRUMP	John, go ahead.	0
82	TRUMP	We have plenty of time.	0
83	QUESTION	Mr. President, thank you very much.	0
84	QUESTION	Of course, what you’re looking forward to tomorrow is the hearings with Judge Kavanaugh —	0
85	TRUMP	Yes.	0
86	QUESTION	— before the Judiciary Committee.	0
87	QUESTION	In 1991, when Joe Biden passed along to the Bush 41 White House the allegations that Anita Hill had raised against Clarence Thomas, the Bush White House asked the FBI to look into it as part of Judge Thomas’s background investigation — not a criminal investigation, but the background investigation.	0
88	TRUMP	Right.	0
89	TRUMP	Right.	0
90	QUESTION	When these allegations were raised, why didn’t this White House do the same thing?	0
91	QUESTION	And with all of the allegations that are coming out now about Judge Kavanaugh, was there an opportunity missed here to have investigators look into this and get some sort of clarity one way or the other?	0
92	TRUMP	Well, the FBI told us they’ve investigated Judge Kavanaugh six times, five times, many times over the years.	0
93	TRUMP	They know him very well.	0
94	TRUMP	But here, there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint.	1
95	TRUMP	They didn’t know the location.	1
96	TRUMP	They didn’t know the time.	1
97	TRUMP	They didn’t know the year.	1
98	TRUMP	They didn’t know anything.	1
99	TRUMP	And it’s like, where do you go?	0
100	TRUMP	Also, it’s not for the FBI.	0
101	TRUMP	If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, "They don’t do this"	1
102	TRUMP	And he said it very clearly.	0
103	TRUMP	So I think when you really look at it all, it’s not going to change any of the Democrats’ minds.	0
104	TRUMP	They’re obstructionists.	0
105	TRUMP	They’re actually con artists because they know how quality this man is and they’ve destroyed a man’s reputation and they want to destroy it even more.	0
106	TRUMP	And I think people are going to see that in the midterms.	0
107	TRUMP	What they’ve done to this family, what they’ve done to these children — these beautiful children of his — and what they’ve done to his wife.	0
108	TRUMP	And they know it’s a big, fat con job.	0
109	TRUMP	And they go into a room and, I guarantee you, they laugh like hell at what they’ve pulled off on you and on the public.	0
110	TRUMP	They laugh like hell.	0
111	TRUMP	So, it wouldn’t have mattered if the FBI came back with the cleanest score.	0
112	TRUMP	And you understand that very well, John.	0
113	TRUMP	If they would have come back with the most perfect — "We found everything, and he’s perfectly innocent of everything"	0
114	TRUMP	It wouldn’t have made a difference.	0
115	TRUMP	You wouldn’t have gotten one vote.	0
116	TRUMP	Now we will get votes from the Democrats if we win.	0
117	TRUMP	You’ll have three, four, or five Democrats giving us votes, because they’re in states that I won by 30 and 40 points and they’re going to give us votes.	0
118	TRUMP	But other than that, you probably won’t get any, John.	0
119	TRUMP	Yes, go ahead.	0
120	TRUMP	Please.	0
121	QUESTION	Mr. President, there are now three women accusing Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.	0
122	QUESTION	Are you saying that all three of those women are liars?	0
123	QUESTION	Is there anything that can be said at this point tomorrow —	0
124	TRUMP	Yeah.	0
125	QUESTION	— that could cause you to withdraw the nomination?	0
126	QUESTION	Anything at all that —	0
127	TRUMP	I won’t get into that game.	0
128	TRUMP	I’ll only tell you this: This is one of the highest quality people that I’ve ever met, and everybody that knows him says the same thing.	0
129	TRUMP	And these are all false — to me, these are false accusations in certain cases.	0
130	TRUMP	And certain cases, even the media agrees with that.	0
131	TRUMP	I can only say that, what they’ve done to this man is incredible.	0
132	TRUMP	You know, it’s very interesting — I pick a lot of judges.	0
133	TRUMP	I have 145 judges I will be picking by the end of a fairly short period of time because President Obama wasn’t big on picking judges.	0
134	TRUMP	When I got there, I said, "How is this possible?"	0
135	TRUMP	I have 145 — including court of appeals — judges.	0
136	TRUMP	And they just didn’t do it.	0
137	TRUMP	You know why?	0
138	TRUMP	They got tired.	0
139	TRUMP	They got complacent.	0
140	TRUMP	Something happened.	0
141	TRUMP	I have 145 judges.	0
142	TRUMP	Everybody wants to be a federal judge.	0
143	TRUMP	Not just a Supreme Court judge, I’m talking about court of appeals; I’m talking about district court.	0
144	TRUMP	I don’t think they’re going to want to so much.	0
145	TRUMP	I’ll be calling people, and we’ll have people calling people that do this.	0
146	TRUMP	And people are going to be scared because we could say it about you, "Thirty-five years ago, you met some…" — and you might know — you might not know what’s going on.	0
147	TRUMP	What is going on?	0
148	TRUMP	Why did they wait so long?	0
149	TRUMP	Why did Senator Feinstein wait until the hearings were over and make this case?	0
150	TRUMP	Why didn’t she bring it right at the beginning?	0
151	TRUMP	When you ask about, as an example, the FBI — why didn’t they bring this right at the beginning, during the hearing?	0
152	TRUMP	You would have had all the time in the world for the FBI.	0
153	TRUMP	It would have been fine.	0
154	TRUMP	Now the FBI, as you know, did investigate this time, as they have five or six other times.	0
155	TRUMP	And they did a very thorough investigation.	0
156	TRUMP	But this is a big con job.	0
157	TRUMP	And I would love to be in the room with the Democrats, close the door — you guys are all away, outside, waiting.	0
158	TRUMP	And Schumer and his buddies are all in there laughing how they fooled you all.	0
159	TRUMP	Let’s just stop them.	0
160	TRUMP	A big fat con.	0
161	TRUMP	Yeah, go ahead.	0
162	QUESTION	But, Mr. President, if I could follow up.	0
163	QUESTION	You have daughters.	0
164	QUESTION	Can you understand why a victim of sexual assault would not report it at the time?	0
165	QUESTION	Don’t you understand —	0
166	TRUMP	By the way, I only say this: thirty-six years — no charge, no nothing.	0
167	TRUMP	Everybody —	0
168	QUESTION	But — but that happens often.	0
169	QUESTION	I mean —	0
170	TRUMP	People are going to have to make a decision.	0
171	TRUMP	Thirty-six years, there’s no charge.	0
172	TRUMP	All of a sudden, the hearings are over and the rumors start coming out.	0
173	TRUMP	And then you have this other con artist, Avenatti, come out with another beauty today.	0
174	TRUMP	I only say that you have to look at the facts.	0
175	TRUMP	The senators are very capable people.	0
176	TRUMP	They’re very good people.	0
177	TRUMP	I know many of them.	0
178	TRUMP	They’re friends of mine.	0
179	TRUMP	These are very talented, very good people.	0
180	TRUMP	And they’re going to vote.	0
181	TRUMP	They’re going to believe what they believe.	0
182	TRUMP	I can — when I look at what’s happened to the reputation of a great gentleman — a great intellect; a brilliant man; somebody that has a chance to be one of our great Supreme Court Justices in history, intellectually — I think it’s a shame.	0
183	TRUMP	Yes, please.	0
184	QUESTION	Yes, Mr. President.	0
185	QUESTION	My name is Tomás Regalado from Radio and TV Marti.	0
186	QUESTION	Mr. President, yesterday at the speech at the U.N., you spoke about how Venezuela’s problem was because of Cuba and the Castros — how they went in there and they brought socialism and communism to Venezuela, and now to Nicaragua as well.	0
187	QUESTION	Mr. President, are you going to be more proactive now against Cuba as well?	0
188	TRUMP	I’ve been very proactive against Cuba.	0
189	TRUMP	I don’t like what’s happening in Cuba.	0
190	TRUMP	As you know, President Obama gave them a pass and I didn’t like it.	0
191	TRUMP	Neither do Cuban people based in Miami and based in our country that came from Cuba and suffered in Cuba.	0
192	TRUMP	I don’t like what he did.	0
193	TRUMP	I’ve ended much of it — most of it.	0
194	TRUMP	I don’t like what’s happening in Cuba, and I certainly don’t like what’s happening in Venezuela.	0
195	TRUMP	Yes, please.	0
196	QUESTION	Mr. President.	0
197	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
198	QUESTION	Mr. President, just to finish really fast.	0
199	QUESTION	You said also that you had a call-to-action to ask the leaders around the world to also end socialism.	0
200	QUESTION	Would you like to be recognized as —	0
201	TRUMP	Well, I wouldn’t say that socialism has been working really well around the world, okay.	0
202	TRUMP	You can take a look at Venezuela as your number one — your number one — I guess, the one that is most obvious.	0
203	TRUMP	But you take a look around the world, socialism is not exactly riding high.	0
204	TRUMP	Please.	0
205	QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
206	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
207	QUESTION	Thank you very much.	0
208	QUESTION	If you don’t mind, after I’m finished, if Weijia, or Hallie, or Vivian, or one of our female colleagues could go after me, that would be great.	0
209	QUESTION	Mr. President, just to follow up on these allegations against Brett Kavanaugh —	0
210	TRUMP	What does he mean by that?	0
211	TRUMP	Explain.	0
212	TRUMP	What does that mean?	0
213	QUESTION	I think it would be great if a female reporter —	0
214	TRUMP	What does it mean?	0
215	TRUMP	No, what does it mean?	0
216	QUESTION	I think it would great if a female reporter would ask you a question about this issue.	0
217	QUESTION	So if you don’t mind, I would ask —	0
218	TRUMP	I wouldn’t mind that at all.	0
219	TRUMP	No.	0
220	TRUMP	Wouldn’t mind it at all.	0
221	QUESTION	All right.	0
222	QUESTION	Well, let me — if I could call on —	0
223	TRUMP	Wouldn’t make any difference to me.	0
224	QUESTION	All right.	0
225	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
226	QUESTION	If I could follow up on John, and John’s question.	0
227	QUESTION	Why is it, Mr. President, that you always seem to side with the accused and not the accuser?	0
228	QUESTION	You have three women here who are all making allegations, who are all asking that their stories be heard.	0
229	QUESTION	And, you know, if you look at the case of Roy Moore, if you look at the case of one of your staffers, you seem to, time and again, side with the accused and not the accuser.	0
230	QUESTION	Is that because of the many allegations that you’ve had made against you over the years?	0
231	TRUMP	Well, first of all, I wasn’t happy with Roy Moore.	0
232	TRUMP	Let’s get that straight.	0
233	TRUMP	But Roy Moore was a Republican candidate —	0
234	QUESTION	But you stood by him.	0
235	TRUMP	— and I would have rather had a Republican candidate win.	0
236	TRUMP	I was very happy with Luther Strange, who was a terrific man from Alabama, but Luther Strange had a lot of things going against him.	0
237	TRUMP	As far as women, whether it’s a man or a woman, these are — you know, it can happen the other way.	0
238	TRUMP	Allegations can go the other way also.	0
239	TRUMP	You understand that.	0
240	TRUMP	And whether it was a man or a woman, 30 years ago, 36 years ago — in fact, they don’t even know how many years ago because nobody knows what the time is.	0
241	TRUMP	That’s a long time.	0
242	TRUMP	And I could pick, as an example — hopefully I won’t have to do it as a replacement because hopefully this is going to go very well on Thursday.	0
243	TRUMP	It’s going to go very well on Monday, or Saturday, or Sunday, or whenever they vote.	0
244	TRUMP	But I could pick a woman and she could have charges made from many years ago also.	0
245	QUESTION	But don’t you understand, sir, that many of these —	0
246	TRUMP	And I would look at the character —	0
247	QUESTION	— many of these accusers —	0
248	TRUMP	No, what I have to do —	0
249	QUESTION	— are reluctant to come forward.	0
250	QUESTION	You’ve raised doubts about these accusers.	0
251	QUESTION	Many of them are reluctant to come forward.	0
252	TRUMP	I don’t think people are reluctant to come forward.	0
253	TRUMP	They’re going to have a chance to speak at a major — they have a major chance to speak.	0
254	QUESTION	But you’re saying why (inaudible) —	0
255	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
256	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
257	TRUMP	They have a major chance to speak.	0
258	TRUMP	And it will be tomorrow, I assume.	0
259	TRUMP	We’ve delayed this — meaning the Republican senators, not me.	0
260	TRUMP	The Republicans senators have delayed this for weeks now.	0
261	TRUMP	They’re giving the women a major chance to speak.	0
262	TRUMP	Now it’s possible I’ll hear that, and I’ll say, "Hey, I’m changing my mind"	0
263	TRUMP	That is possible.	0
264	TRUMP	We want to give them a chance to speak.	0
265	TRUMP	And they’re given —	0
266	QUESTION	Do you think all three should have a chance — all three should have a chance to speak?	0
267	TRUMP	Well, whoever is given a chance.	0
268	TRUMP	We’ve delayed it a long time.	0
269	TRUMP	But they’re going to have a big shot at speaking and making their case.	0
270	TRUMP	And you know what?	0
271	TRUMP	I could be persuaded also.	0
272	TRUMP	Okay?	0
273	TRUMP	Yes.	0
274	TRUMP	Please.	0
275	TRUMP	Please, go ahead.	0
276	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
277	TRUMP	I would like to go — yes, go ahead.	0
278	TRUMP	Please.	0
279	QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
280	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
281	QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
282	QUESTION	And a couple of questions for you to follow up on some answers that I didn’t quite hear from you, if you would allow me a couple of questions.	0
283	QUESTION	First of all, do you think these women — all three of them are liars?	0
284	QUESTION	Yes or no?	0
285	TRUMP	Have they been what?	0
286	QUESTION	Are they liars?	0
287	TRUMP	I can’t tell you.	0
288	TRUMP	I have to watch tomorrow.	0
289	TRUMP	I have to read.	0
290	TRUMP	I just heard about one a little while ago.	0
291	TRUMP	I can tell you her lawyer is a low life, okay?	0
292	TRUMP	So I can’t tell you whether or not they’re liars until I hear them.	0
293	TRUMP	I don’t know what happened today because I’ve been very busy with Japan, with South Korea, with China, and about seven other countries, as you know — and I chaired the Security Council.	0
294	TRUMP	So I don’t know about today’s person that came forward.	0
295	TRUMP	I do know about the lawyer.	0
296	TRUMP	And you don’t get much worse — bad reputation, too.	0
297	TRUMP	Take a look at his past.	0
298	TRUMP	So, as far as the other women are concerned, I’m going to see what happens tomorrow.	0
299	TRUMP	I’m going to be watching — you know, believe it or not.	0
300	TRUMP	I’m going to see what’s said.	0
301	TRUMP	It’s possible that they will be convincing.	0
302	TRUMP	Now, with all of that being said, Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been, for many years, one of the most respected people in Washington.	0
303	TRUMP	He’s been on — I guess you’d call it the second highest court.	0
304	TRUMP	And every single person knows him; a lot of people know him well. And those people don’t believe what’s going on.	0
305	TRUMP	I can always be convinced.	0
306	TRUMP	I have to hear it.	0
307	QUESTION	It sounds like what you’re saying is, there is a situation, there is a scenario under which you would withdraw Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination.	0
308	QUESTION	Is that correct?	0
309	QUESTION	And have you talked about that with him?	0
310	TRUMP	If I thought he was — if I thought he was guilty of something like this, yeah sure.	0
311	QUESTION	And you will wait until tomorrow to make up your mind about it?	0
312	TRUMP	I want to watch.	0
313	TRUMP	I want to see.	0
314	TRUMP	I hope I can watch.	0
315	TRUMP	I’m meeting with a lot of countries tomorrow, but I will certainly, in some form, be able to watch.	0
316	TRUMP	And I’ll also rely on some very fair and talented Republican senators who — look, if we brought George Washington here and we said, "We have George Washington," the Democrats would vote against him, just so you understand.	0
317	TRUMP	And he may have had a bad past, who knows, you know.	0
318	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
319	TRUMP	He may have had some, I think, accusations made.	0
320	TRUMP	Didn’t he have a couple of things in his past?	0
321	TRUMP	George Washington would be voted against 100 percent by Schumer and the con artists.	0
322	TRUMP	I mean 100 percent.	0
323	TRUMP	One hundred percent.	0
324	TRUMP	So it really doesn’t matter from their standpoint.	0
325	TRUMP	That’s why when John asked about the FBI — if the FBI did the most thorough investigation in the history of the FBI, and they found him to be 100-percent perfect, he would lose every single vote.	0
326	TRUMP	Now, if the Republicans win tomorrow, I think you’re going to get some votes from the Democrats.	0
327	TRUMP	You know why?	0
328	TRUMP	Because — we all know why — because it’s called politics.	0
329	TRUMP	Then you’ll probably get some votes.	0
330	TRUMP	Okay, let’s go.	0
331	QUESTION	And my final question, sir,	0
332	TRUMP	One more question.	0
333	QUESTION	Yes.	0
334	QUESTION	Just to follow up —	0
335	TRUMP	She stands up: "I’d like to ask about three questions"	0
336	TRUMP	It’s not really fair to everyone else.	0
337	QUESTION	This will be my last one —	0
338	TRUMP	Should I let her ask another question?	0
339	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
340	QUESTION	— to follow up on —	0
341	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
342	TRUMP	See?	0
343	QUESTION	— to follow up on a question that a colleague asked as well about the benefit of the doubt that you have given to people like Roy Moore, to Roger Ailes, to Bill O’Reilly, to Brett Kavanaugh.	0
344	QUESTION	They’re all men.	0
345	QUESTION	Why is that?	0
346	TRUMP	It’s not a benefit of the doubt.	0
347	TRUMP	I’ve —	0
348	QUESTION	Has there ever been an instance when you’ve given the benefit of the doubt to a woman?	0
349	TRUMP	I’ve known them.	0
350	TRUMP	Hallie, I’ve know them for a long time and — a lot of these people.	0
351	TRUMP	A lot of people.	0
352	TRUMP	And some I’ve been disappointed with.	0
353	TRUMP	I have been disappointed with some.	0
354	TRUMP	Others, like — you know, there are charges that are pretty weak.	0
355	TRUMP	But I’ve known people for a long time.	0
356	TRUMP	I never saw them do anything wrong.	0
357	TRUMP	I never saw them do anything wrong.	0
358	TRUMP	And there are some that probably — I agree.	0
359	TRUMP	I can tell you there are some that I — I’ve been watching for a long time.	0
360	TRUMP	And in a couple of cases, they weren’t Republicans.	0
361	TRUMP	In a lot of cases, they were not; they were exactly the opposite.	0
362	TRUMP	But I’ve been watching them for a long time.	0
363	TRUMP	And I knew for a long time these were not good people.	0
364	TRUMP	And they were never brought up.	0
365	TRUMP	Okay.	0
366	TRUMP	Yes, ma’am.	0
367	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
368	TRUMP	Thank you very much by the way.	0
369	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
370	QUESTION	Thank you very much, Mr. President.	0
371	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
372	QUESTION	When the allegations first surfaced, you initially said how important it was for Dr. Ford to testify and that you wanted to hear from her.	0
373	TRUMP	I do.	0
374	QUESTION	But —	0
375	TRUMP	I wish it could have gone quicker.	0
376	QUESTION	Well, you also said that if what she said were as bad as she claims, surely her or her parents would have reported it.	0
377	QUESTION	And just today, you said, you wouldn’t —	0
378	TRUMP	Well, there is a truth.	0
379	QUESTION	I mean there is a chance that her parents could have reported it 36 years ago.	0
380	QUESTION	So my question is —	0
381	TRUMP	It doesn’t mean they had to report it because, in some instances, people keep it quiet.	0
382	TRUMP	It’s a very tough situation for a woman, there’s no question about it.	0
383	TRUMP	And in some cases, they do report it.	0
384	TRUMP	Frankly, had they reported it, it would’ve been pretty amazing, wouldn’t it?	0
385	TRUMP	But I guess they didn’t, and that’s okay.	0
386	TRUMP	I’m not saying they had to report it because it’s a very personal thing.	0
387	TRUMP	It’s a very big problem, there’s no question about it.	0
388	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
389	QUESTION	But do you want to hear her story before you draw a conclusion —	0
390	TRUMP	I’d like to hear her story, yeah.	0
391	TRUMP	Well, we’re giving her a time.	0
392	QUESTION	— or have you already made up your mind?	0
393	TRUMP	They would’ve given her time last week.	0
394	TRUMP	This is the United States Senate.	0
395	TRUMP	This is the most important position that a President can give out, I think we can say, by far.	0
396	TRUMP	I’ve actually heard it’s the most important decision a President can make.	0
397	TRUMP	I disagree with that.	0
398	TRUMP	War and peace — I always say, "War and peace"	0
399	TRUMP	And after that, Supreme Court Justice.	0
400	TRUMP	Right?	0
401	TRUMP	I look forward to hearing from her.	0
402	TRUMP	We could’ve heard from her last week; we could have heard from her for a long time.	0
403	TRUMP	It’ll be interesting to hear what she has to say.	0
404	TRUMP	Okay?	0
405	QUESTION	And let me follow up on Jim’s question.	0
406	QUESTION	Mr. President, let me follow up on Jim’s question that I don’t think we got an answer to.	0
407	TRUMP	Which one?	0
408	TRUMP	Which question?	0
409	TRUMP	Who?	0
410	QUESTION	How have your personal experiences being accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct —	0
411	TRUMP	I’ve been accused.	0
412	TRUMP	I’ve been accused.	0
413	TRUMP	False accusations.	0
414	QUESTION	— right, how have those —	0
415	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
416	TRUMP	I’ve been accused.	0
417	TRUMP	And I was accused by — I believe, it was — four women.	0
418	TRUMP	You can check with Sean Hannity.	0
419	TRUMP	You can check with Fox, because they covered it very strongly — who got paid.	1
420	QUESTION	And how has (inaudible) —	0
421	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
422	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
423	TRUMP	I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me.	1
424	TRUMP	We caught them, and the mainstream media refused to put it on television.	0
425	TRUMP	They refused to even write about it.	0
426	TRUMP	There were four women, and maybe more — I think the number is four or five.	0
427	TRUMP	But one had a mortgage paid off her house, $52,000.	1
428	TRUMP	Another one had other things happen.	0
429	TRUMP	And the one that reported it, I believe, was offered $750,000 to say bad things about me — and she is the one that reported it.	0
430	TRUMP	This woman is incredible.	0
431	TRUMP	She reported it, instead of taking the money.	0
432	TRUMP	So I’ve had numerous accusations about me.	0
433	QUESTION	Right.	0
434	TRUMP	I mean, they made false statements about me, knowing they were false.	0
435	TRUMP	I never met them.	0
436	TRUMP	I never met these people.	0
437	TRUMP	And, what did they do?	0
438	TRUMP	What did they do?	0
439	TRUMP	They took money in order to say bad things.	1
440	TRUMP	I’ve had stories written in the New York Times — front page — about four women.	0
441	TRUMP	The whole top center front page of the New York Times.	0
442	TRUMP	I think it was four big pictures.	0
443	TRUMP	I said, "Wow. That’s a big thing. What’s that?"	0
444	TRUMP	These were women that were quoted saying bad things about me.	0
445	TRUMP	Not the worst things about me, but bad things.	0
446	TRUMP	And I said, "Gee, that’s too bad"	0
447	TRUMP	I knew them a long time ago — 15 years ago, 20 years ago.	0
448	TRUMP	I said, "That’s too bad. I’m surprised at them."	0
449	TRUMP	And then all of a sudden I see them on television — nothing to do with me.	0
450	TRUMP	The next day or a day later, they were incensed.	0
451	TRUMP	They said, "Donald Trump is a nice guy. We never said this. The New York Times did false reporting. They’re fake news"	0
452	TRUMP	And you know what?	0
453	TRUMP	The New York Times would not report that their story was fake.	0
454	TRUMP	These women said great things. Not only did they not say the bad stuff, they said great things about me.	0
455	TRUMP	Front page.	0
456	TRUMP	And those women — they’re incredible women — they went on television — and they didn’t want to, and I didn’t ask them.	0
457	TRUMP	And they said, "The New York Times made it up. They gave false quotes"	0
458	TRUMP	And they went on a lot of shows.	0
459	TRUMP	They were really incensed and they couldn’t believe it.	0
460	TRUMP	That’s why people know that a lot of the news is fake.	0
461	TRUMP	And a lot of the people sitting here are fake.	0
462	TRUMP	But 20 percent of them are wonderful.	0
463	TRUMP	Okay?	0
464	QUESTION	If I could just actually ask my question, Mr. Trump.	0
465	QUESTION	I — you didn’t let me ask my question.	0
466	TRUMP	You’ve been asking a question for 10 minutes, all right?	0
467	QUESTION	No, you interrupted my question.	0
468	TRUMP	Please sit down. Please.	0
469	QUESTION	I’m asking you —	0
470	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
471	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
472	QUESTION	— how did those impact your opinions on the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh?	0
473	TRUMP	Well, it does impact my opinion.	0
474	TRUMP	You know why?	0
475	TRUMP	Because I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me.	0
476	TRUMP	I’m a very famous person, unfortunately.	0
477	TRUMP	I’ve been a famous person for a long time.	0
478	TRUMP	But I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me — really false charges.	0
479	TRUMP	I know friends that have had false charges.	0
480	TRUMP	People want fame.	0
481	TRUMP	They want money.	0
482	TRUMP	They want whatever.	0
483	TRUMP	So when I see it, I view it differently than somebody sitting home watching television, where they say, "Oh, Judge Kavanaugh…" this or that.	0
484	TRUMP	It’s happened to me many times.	0
485	TRUMP	I’ve had many false charges; I had a woman sitting in an airplane and I attacked her while people were coming onto the plane.	0
486	TRUMP	And I have a number-one bestseller out?	0
487	TRUMP	I mean it was total phony story.	0
488	TRUMP	There are many of them.	0
489	TRUMP	So when you say, does it affect me in terms of my thinking with respect to Judge Kavanaugh?	0
490	TRUMP	Absolutely.	0
491	TRUMP	Because I’ve had it many times.	0
492	TRUMP	And if the news would have reported these four people — I couldn’t believe it.	0
493	TRUMP	When I heard that they caught these four people, I said, "Wow. That’s a big story"	0
494	TRUMP	And it was — for Fox.	0
495	TRUMP	Okay.	0
496	QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
497	QUESTION	Earlier today and just now, you made a significant allegation against the Chinese government.	0
498	QUESTION	You suggested that the Chinese —	0
499	TRUMP	I did.	0
500	QUESTION	— had meddled in or are meddling in —	0
501	TRUMP	That’s right.	0
502	TRUMP	That’s what I hear.	0
503	QUESTION	— the 2018 midterm elections.	0
504	TRUMP	That’s what I hear.	0
505	QUESTION	What evidence do you have of that, sir?	0
506	QUESTION	Is there a national intelligence estimate, for example, that you’re prepared to put forward?	0
507	TRUMP	We have evidence.	0
508	TRUMP	We have evidence.	0
509	TRUMP	It’ll come out.	0
510	TRUMP	Yeah, I can’t tell you now, but it came — it didn’t come out of nowhere, that I can tell you.	0
511	TRUMP	Now, if you — they’ve actually admitted that they’re going after farmers.	0
512	TRUMP	I mean, I think most of you can cover that.	0
513	TRUMP	I like that you’re shaking your head, "yes"	0
514	TRUMP	I’m going to ask you the next question because of that. Okay?	0
515	TRUMP	It’s probably going to be the killer of all questions.	0
516	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
517	TRUMP	But let me just explain —	0
518	QUESTION	But why make the charges now —	0
519	TRUMP	No, no, no.	0
520	TRUMP	Let me —	0
521	QUESTION	— if you’re not prepared to come forward with the evidence, sir?	0
522	TRUMP	China, now, put on $250 billion, and they’re paying 25 percent on that.	0
523	TRUMP	They’re paying billions and billions.	0
524	TRUMP	This has never happened to China.	0
525	TRUMP	And I like China.	0
526	TRUMP	And I like President Xi a lot.	0
527	TRUMP	I think he’s a friend of mine.	0
528	TRUMP	He may not be a friend of mine anymore, but he — I think he probably respects —	0
529	TRUMP	From what I hear — if you look at Mr. Pillsbury, the leading authority on China — he was on a good show — I won’t mention the name of the show — recently.	0
530	TRUMP	And he was saying that China has total respect for Donald Trump and for Donald Trump’s very, very large brain.	0
531	TRUMP	He said, "Donald. Donald Trump. They don’t know what to do"	0
532	TRUMP	It never happened.	0
533	TRUMP	Well, one thing they are trying to do is they are trying to convince people to go against Donald Trump.	0
534	TRUMP	Because a normal, regular, political person that has no concept of what the hell he’s doing would let China continue to take $500 billion a year out of our country and rebuild their country.	1
535	TRUMP	I mean, they were building 29 massive bridges like the George Washington Bridge.	0
536	TRUMP	They’re building things that we don’t build anymore.	0
537	TRUMP	But we’re starting to build them again.	0
538	TRUMP	And our economy now is hotter than it’s ever been. I don’t know you if you saw the confidence levels this morning that just came out.	0
539	TRUMP	Fantastic.	0
540	TRUMP	And in all fairness to the Fed raising rates, they’re raising rates because we’ve never done like we’re doing now.	0
541	TRUMP	And one of the things that is nice about the rates — the people that were hurt the worst by these zero interest rates and, you know —	0
542	TRUMP	When President Obama had an economy that was — it was the worst comeback since the Great Depression and all that — you’ve all heard that.	0
543	TRUMP	But remember, he was playing with zero-interest money.	0
544	TRUMP	He was playing with funny money.	0
545	TRUMP	That’s easy.	0
546	TRUMP	I’m playing with fairly expensive money.	0
547	TRUMP	So when he does that, the people that benefit are people that actually — in their whole life, they would save 10, 15, 20 percent of their salary and put it in the bank.	0
548	TRUMP	Those people got killed because they put their money in the bank.	0
549	TRUMP	They were going to live off the interest, and there was no interest.	0
550	TRUMP	Now, those people are starting to get interest.	0
551	TRUMP	And those are the people, frankly, that deserve to — you know, they did a great job.	0
552	TRUMP	The people that did it right, the people that did the best job got hurt the most.	0
553	TRUMP	So in one sense I like it, but basically I’m a low-interest-rate person.	0
554	TRUMP	I hate to tell you.	0
555	TRUMP	Yes.	0
556	TRUMP	Yes, ma’am.	0
557	TRUMP	Yes.	0
558	TRUMP	Yes, go ahead.	0
559	QUESTION	Mr. President, you have another meeting tomorrow with Rod Rosenstein.	0
560	TRUMP	Yes.	0
561	QUESTION	Are you planning to fire Rod Rosenstein?	0
562	TRUMP	I’m talking to him.	0
563	TRUMP	We’ve had a good talk.	0
564	TRUMP	He said he never said it.	0
565	TRUMP	He said he doesn’t believe it.	0
566	TRUMP	He said he has a lot of respect for me, and he was very nice and we’ll see.	0
567	TRUMP	And he’s a member of the Trump administration, in that sense; it’s the Justice Department.	0
568	TRUMP	I would certainly prefer not doing that.	0
569	TRUMP	There was no collusion.	0
570	TRUMP	There was no obstruction — I mean, unless you call obstruction the fact that I fight back.	0
571	TRUMP	I do fight back.	0
572	TRUMP	I really fight back.	0
573	TRUMP	I mean, if you call that obstruction, that’s fine.	0
574	TRUMP	But there’s no obstruction.	0
575	TRUMP	There’s no collusion.	0
576	TRUMP	I’m going to meet with him tomorrow.	0
577	TRUMP	I may call Rod tonight or tomorrow and ask for a little bit of a delay to the meeting, because I don’t want to do anything that gets in the way of this very important Supreme Court pick.	0
578	TRUMP	So I don’t want it competing and hurting the decision — one way or the other decision.	0
579	TRUMP	Again, I want to hear what she has to say.	0
580	TRUMP	But I want to do — so I may delay that.	0
581	TRUMP	I’m going to see.	0
582	TRUMP	I don’t want to do anything that’s going to conflict with that.	0
583	TRUMP	But my preference would be to keep him, and to let him finish up.	0
584	TRUMP	You know, I call it a "witch hunt"	0
585	TRUMP	And it is a witch hunt.	0
586	TRUMP	If you look at the FBI statements with Strzok and his lover Lisa Page.	0
587	TRUMP	If you look at all of the things that have gone on in the FBI.	0
588	TRUMP	If you look at McCabe taking $700,000 from a Hillary Clinton-PAC essentially run by Terry McAuliffe, who’s her best friend in the world, and he gives them hundreds of thousands of dollars.	1
589	TRUMP	And he’s in charge of her campaign, and his wife is getting all of this money to run — she lost — to run.	0
590	TRUMP	I mean, what’s going on?	0
591	TRUMP	If you look at the horrible statements, like "Way to go, Page. Great story you put into a newspaper"	0
592	TRUMP	Essentially, now we’ll go and investigate that group.	0
593	TRUMP	It’s terrible.	0
594	TRUMP	We have caught people doing things that are terrible.	0
595	TRUMP	I would much prefer keeping Rod Rosenstein.	0
596	TRUMP	Much prefer.	0
597	TRUMP	Many people say I have the right to absolutely fire him.	0
598	TRUMP	He said he did not say it.	0
599	TRUMP	He said he does not believe that.	0
600	TRUMP	And nobody in this room believes it.	0
601	TRUMP	By the way, I deal with the people in this room.	0
602	TRUMP	I was with Mike Pompeo before, and we were dealing, at a very high level, with Japan.	0
603	TRUMP	And I was saying things that nobody in the room even understood.	0
604	TRUMP	And I said them a long time ago, and I was right.	0
605	TRUMP	He said, "That’s not the 25th Amendment that I’m looking at"	0
606	TRUMP	I think I can say that from Mike.	0
607	QUESTION	So you don’t think anyone in your administration has ever discussed using the 25th Amendment against you?	0
608	TRUMP	I don’t think so.	0
609	TRUMP	Well, yeah — enemies, sure.	0
610	TRUMP	You use anything you can.	0
611	QUESTION	Was it in your administration or your Cabinet?	0
612	TRUMP	Hey, you use anything they can.	0
613	TRUMP	They’re not in love with me.	0
614	TRUMP	They’re not going to beat me in the election; they know that.	0
615	TRUMP	They’re not going to beat me.	0
616	TRUMP	The people that I’m looking at are total lightweights.	0
617	TRUMP	I dream of running against those people.	0
618	QUESTION	But within your administration?	0
619	TRUMP	Maybe they’ll come up with somebody that’s not — they’re not going to beat me.	0
620	TRUMP	I’m against what they want to do.	0
621	TRUMP	I’m in favor of law enforcement.	0
622	TRUMP	I’m in favor of safety and security, and low taxes.	0
623	TRUMP	I want low taxes.	0
624	TRUMP	I want borders.	0
625	TRUMP	We’re getting another $1.6 billion in borders.	1
626	TRUMP	I want borders.	0
627	TRUMP	We’ve spent $3.2 [billion] and we’re getting another $1.6 [billion].	1
628	TRUMP	And then eventually, we’re getting the whole thing and we’ll complete the wall.	0
629	TRUMP	They don’t want that.	0
630	TRUMP	They don’t want that.	0
631	TRUMP	They don’t want the things that I have.	0
632	TRUMP	Now, I must say, I know many of the Democrats.	0
633	TRUMP	They’ll say things and then wink at me.	0
634	TRUMP	And again, it’s the same old story.	0
635	TRUMP	They’ll say things; they don’t mean it.	0
636	TRUMP	Its politics.	0
637	TRUMP	The reason they don’t want me is because they want to run the show.	0
638	TRUMP	They want it.	0
639	TRUMP	It’s power.	0
640	TRUMP	It’s whatever you want to call it.	0
641	TRUMP	But what they’ve done here is a disgrace.	0
642	TRUMP	A total disgrace.	0
643	TRUMP	And what they do — I know, it’s sort of interesting — in one case, they say, "He’s a fascist. He’s taking over the government. He’s the most powerful President ever. He’s a horrible human being. He wants to take over the entire government, and he’s going to do it. We can’t stop him"	0
644	TRUMP	That didn’t work.	0
645	TRUMP	The next week, he said, "Uh, he’s incompetent"	0
646	TRUMP	I said, "Well, wait a minute"	0
647	TRUMP	In one case, I’m taking over the world.	0
648	TRUMP	And in the other case, "He’s incompetent"	0
649	TRUMP	They tried that for a week.	0
650	TRUMP	That didn’t work.	0
651	TRUMP	Look, these are very dishonest people.	0
652	TRUMP	These are con artists.	0
653	TRUMP	And the press knows it, but the press doesn’t write it.	0
654	TRUMP	Wow.	0
655	TRUMP	That’s a lot of hands.	0
656	TRUMP	That’s a lot of — oh, Steve, go ahead.	0
657	TRUMP	He is a very high quality person, this man.	0
658	TRUMP	But he’ll probably hit me with a bad one.	0
659	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
660	QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
661	QUESTION	Why —	0
662	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
663	TRUMP	Give it to me.	0
664	TRUMP	Give it to me, Steve.	0
665	TRUMP	Reuters.	0
666	QUESTION	You’re getting letters from Chairman Kim.	0
667	QUESTION	Why do you need a second summit with the North Korean leader so soon?	0
668	QUESTION	And what do you —	0
669	TRUMP	Because he’d like it.	0
670	QUESTION	What would it be for?	0
671	TRUMP	So I’ve received two letters from Chairman Kim.	0
672	TRUMP	At some point, I’ll, you know, give these letters — they’re incredible letters.	0
673	TRUMP	They’re letters that are magnificent in the sense of his feeling for wanting to get this done.	0
674	TRUMP	I really believe he wants to get it done.	0
675	TRUMP	I may be wrong.	0
676	TRUMP	I heard somebody on a certain network last night — I won’t mention which one — say, "Why has President Trump given so much to North Korea?"	0
677	TRUMP	I said, "Wait a minute"	0
678	TRUMP	I asked Sarah Huckabee, "Please call this person"	0
679	TRUMP	I gave nothing — other than I met.	0
680	TRUMP	What did I give them?	0
681	TRUMP	I didn’t do what Obama did:  Give them $1.8 billion in cash to get back four hostages.	0
682	TRUMP	I got back our hostages; I never paid them anything.	0
683	TRUMP	I haven’t paid them 10 cents.	0
684	TRUMP	But he wants to make a deal and I’d like to make a deal.	0
685	TRUMP	We actually have a very good relationship together — a lot different than the last time I was at the United Nations.	0
686	TRUMP	That was a little bit rough.	0
687	TRUMP	Don’t forget, that time, they said, "Oh, Trump is saying these horrible things. He’s going to get us into a war"	0
688	TRUMP	You were going to have a war.	0
689	TRUMP	If I wasn’t elected, you’d be in war.	0
690	TRUMP	And President Obama essentially said the same thing.	0
691	TRUMP	He was ready to go to war.	0
692	TRUMP	You would have had a war, and you would have lost millions, not thousands.	0
693	TRUMP	You would have lost millions of people.	0
694	TRUMP	Seoul has 30 million people — 40 miles and 30 miles from this very dangerous border.	0
695	TRUMP	If I wasn’t elected, you would have had a war.	0
696	TRUMP	President Obama thought you had to go to war.	0
697	TRUMP	You know how close he was to pressing the trigger for war?	0
698	TRUMP	Millions of people.	0
699	TRUMP	With me, nobody is talking about that.	0
700	TRUMP	Nobody is talking about that.	0
701	TRUMP	We have a very good relationship.	0
702	TRUMP	He likes me.	0
703	TRUMP	I like him.	0
704	TRUMP	We get along.	0
705	TRUMP	He wrote me two of the most beautiful letters.	0
706	TRUMP	When I showed one of the letters — just one — to Prime Minister Abe, he said, "This is actually a groundbreaking letter. This is an incredible — this is a historic letter"	0
707	TRUMP	And it is a historic letter.	0
708	TRUMP	It’s a beautiful — it’s a beautiful piece of art.	0
709	TRUMP	And I think we’re going to make a deal.	0
710	TRUMP	Will we make a deal, Steve?	0
711	TRUMP	I don’t really know.	0
712	TRUMP	But I think we’re going to.	0
713	TRUMP	In the meantime — and I’ve said it a thousand — I don’t want to bore you: no rockets, no missiles, no nuclear tests — you know, for over a year, where you haven’t seen.	0
714	TRUMP	Before I got here, everybody in this room thought you were going to war.	0
715	TRUMP	And then what happened — it was funny — they said, "He was terrible. He was so rough with Chairman Kim — Kim Jong Un. He was so rough. It’s terrible. He’s going to cause…"	0
716	TRUMP	Well, I had a great meeting with President Putin.	0
717	TRUMP	And on that one, they said, "He was too soft with President Putin"	0
718	TRUMP	I had a great meeting with the President.	0
719	TRUMP	It lasted for two hours.	0
720	TRUMP	We discussed everything: Ukraine, Syria, Israel and Israel’s protection.	0
721	TRUMP	We had a great meeting.	0
722	TRUMP	They wanted me to end up in a boxing match.	0
723	TRUMP	And you know what?	0
724	TRUMP	If I was killer-tough with President Putin, they would have said, "He was too tough"	0
725	TRUMP	You can’t win with these people, but you just keep going.	0
726	TRUMP	In the meantime, we’re doing well.	0
727	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
728	QUESTION	So how do you — how long do you —	0
729	TRUMP	Wait.	0
730	TRUMP	One second.	0
731	QUESTION	How long do you think it should take North Korea to denuclearize?	0
732	TRUMP	I don’t know.	0
733	TRUMP	I don’t want to get into —	0
734	QUESTION	We’ve seen estimates of one year, two year —	0
735	TRUMP	Steve, I don’t want to get into the time game.	0
736	TRUMP	You know why?	0
737	TRUMP	I told Mike Pompeo, I said, "Mike, don’t get into the time game"	0
738	TRUMP	We stopped them.	0
739	TRUMP	They’re taking down plants.	0
740	TRUMP	They’re taking down a lot of different testing areas.	0
741	TRUMP	They’re going to take down some more.	0
742	TRUMP	You’ll be hearing about that very soon.	0
743	TRUMP	I don’t want to go ahead of myself, but you’ll be hearing about it soon.	0
744	TRUMP	They have no interest right now in testing nuclear.	0
745	TRUMP	You know, we had a case just about when I was coming into office — you all remember it — where there was a massive — they thought it was an earthquake.	0
746	TRUMP	A mountain moved over an inch and a half.	0
747	TRUMP	We’re talking about mountains.	0
748	TRUMP	You know, North Korea is very mountainous.	0
749	TRUMP	Beautiful land.	0
750	TRUMP	Beautiful.	0
751	TRUMP	This mountain actually shifted.	0
752	TRUMP	It shifted.	0
753	TRUMP	And somebody thought it was an earthquake.	0
754	TRUMP	And then they found out, no, this was nuclear testing.	0
755	TRUMP	Shifted a mountain.	0
756	TRUMP	Now I’m talking about serious stuff.	0
757	TRUMP	Serious size.	0
758	TRUMP	When I came in, and certainly before I came in — and even at the beginning of mine because when I was having rhetorical contests — you know, contests, really, I guess you could call it — with Chairman Kim, which we both smile at now and we laugh at.	0
759	TRUMP	But everybody thought that was a horrible thing.	0
760	TRUMP	We’ve had — many Presidents were unable to do anything, anything at all with North Korea.	0
761	TRUMP	We now have a good relationship.	0
762	TRUMP	We have a good relationship.	0
763	TRUMP	And most importantly, all of the things that you’ve been hearing about –the horror stories — in my opinion, they’re gone.	0
764	TRUMP	Now, could they start up again?	0
765	TRUMP	Yes.	0
766	TRUMP	I’m a deal guy.	0
767	TRUMP	Could they start?	0
768	TRUMP	Yeah.	0
769	TRUMP	Could be that we don’t work it out.	0
770	TRUMP	I think — I have it right here — I think that what we’ve done behind the scenes, which nobody really knows about — and I don’t blame you for not knowing about, you know, personal letters, private letters.	0
771	TRUMP	But saying they want to get it done.	0
772	TRUMP	We know much more than the media for a change.	0
773	TRUMP	Much more.	0
774	TRUMP	But if you saw what’s going on behind the scenes, I think you’d very impressed.	0
775	TRUMP	We were a country going to war.	0
776	TRUMP	I really believe that President Obama would admit that he said it’s by far his biggest problem.	0
777	TRUMP	When I sat with him, prior to going to office — going into office, he said to me that’s by far the biggest problem.	0
778	TRUMP	And he said to me that he was very close to going into war.	0
779	TRUMP	And millions of people — not — you know, I — they say, "Oh, thousands of people…"	0
780	TRUMP	No, no, no, not thousands.	0
781	TRUMP	Millions of people would have been killed.	0
782	TRUMP	And that could have left — you’re right next to China.	0
783	TRUMP	You’re right — that could have been a world war very easily.	0
784	TRUMP	Right now, we’re in a great position.	0
785	TRUMP	I don’t want to play the time game.	0
786	TRUMP	I told Mike Pompeo, "Don’t let them do that to you"	0
787	TRUMP	I haven’t given anything.	0
788	TRUMP	And all of a sudden — we got back, it was a few weeks ago.	0
789	TRUMP	I think we were back like two and a half months from the summit, which was a great success.	0
790	TRUMP	And people are screaming, "What’s taking so long?"	0
791	TRUMP	I said, "Oh, I get it"	0
792	TRUMP	You got to understand the media.	0
793	TRUMP	I’ve been dealing with the media all my life.	0
794	TRUMP	Too much.	0
795	TRUMP	Too much.	0
796	TRUMP	They’re screaming and I saw that.	0
797	TRUMP	And our guys were — and not Mike — but our guys were being, "Oh well, we’re working as fast…"	0
798	TRUMP	 I said, "I got all the time in the world. I don’t have to rush it"	0
799	TRUMP	There’s no — you know, secession of sanctions.	0
800	TRUMP	We got the sanctions on.	0
801	TRUMP	I didn’t take any sanctions off.	0
802	TRUMP	I did see a reporter last night — a guy I like, personally, a lot.	0
803	TRUMP	And he asked a question to President Moon of South Korea.	0
804	TRUMP	He said, "Why did the President give so much?"	0
805	TRUMP	I didn’t give anything.	0
806	TRUMP	I gave nothing.	0
807	TRUMP	What have I given, other than some time?	0
808	TRUMP	Yes, I flew to Singapore.	0
809	TRUMP	We had a meeting.	0
810	TRUMP	Now, giving would be if I took the sanctions off.	0
811	TRUMP	I didn’t want to do — if you asked General Mattis, for a year and a half, I said, "Why don’t we stop these ridiculous," in my opinion, "the military games?"	0
812	TRUMP	I call them the "military games"	0
813	TRUMP	If I told you how much those games cost — and, frankly, I told South Korea, "You should be paying for these games"	0
814	TRUMP	We pay for them.	0
815	TRUMP	They say, "Well, we fly the planes in from a short distance away"	0
816	TRUMP	I said, "Where is that?"	0
817	TRUMP	"Guam"	0
818	TRUMP	Oh, huh.	0
819	TRUMP	How long a trip is that?	0
820	TRUMP	"Seven hours"	0
821	TRUMP	Oh, great	0
822	TRUMP	We’re flying these massive bombers and everything.	0
823	TRUMP	I’ve wanted to stop this for a long time.	0
824	TRUMP	I consider that an asset.	0
825	TRUMP	But we’ve done — we’re saving, by the way — just for the taxpayer, we’re saving a fortune.	0
826	TRUMP	And if we need them, we can start them up immediately.	0
827	TRUMP	If I think we need them, I’ll start them before the generals will start them.	0
828	TRUMP	The fact is, this reporter said that.	0
829	TRUMP	I said, "What have we done? I haven’t given anything"	0
830	TRUMP	And we’re really onto the cusp.	0
831	TRUMP	I think we’re really going to do something that’s going to be very important.	0
832	TRUMP	But we’re not playing the time game.	0
833	TRUMP	If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.	0
834	TRUMP	There’s no nuclear testing and there’s no testing of rockets.	0
835	TRUMP	Yes, ma’am.	0
836	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
837	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
838	TRUMP	Please.	0

854	QUESTION	Are you at all concerned at the message that has been sending — being sent to the women who are watching this when you use language like "con job" in relation to allegations of sexual assault?	0
855	TRUMP	Oh, I’ve used much worse language in my life than "con job"	0
856	TRUMP	That’s like probably the nicest phrase I’ve ever used.	0
857	TRUMP	I mean, con job — it is.	0
858	TRUMP	It’s a con job.	0
859	TRUMP	You know, confidence — it’s a confidence job.	0
860	TRUMP	But they short — it’s a con job by the Democrats.	0
861	TRUMP	They know it.	0
862	QUESTION	What about the message that’s being sent to women who are watching?	0
863	TRUMP	They did the same thing with the Russia investigation.	0
864	TRUMP	They tried to convince people that I had something to do with Russia.	0
865	TRUMP	There was no collusion.	0
866	TRUMP	Think of it.	0
867	TRUMP	I’m in Wisconsin.	0
868	TRUMP	I’m in Michigan.	0
869	TRUMP	I say, "Gee, we’re not doing well"	0
870	TRUMP	I won both those states.	0
871	TRUMP	We’re not doing well.	0
872	TRUMP	Uh, let me call the Russians to help	0
873	TRUMP	Does anybody really believe that?	0
874	TRUMP	It’s a con job.	0
875	TRUMP	And I watch these guys — Little Adam Schiff, and all of the guys.	0
876	TRUMP	He takes a call from a Russian who turned out to be a faker.	0
877	TRUMP	You know, he was a comedian or something.	0
878	TRUMP	This is so-and-so calling for… — he took the call.	0
879	TRUMP	Why is the taking a call from a Russian?	0
880	TRUMP	Senator Warner took a call from a Russian.	0
881	TRUMP	He was a comedian or something, but he said, "We have pictures of President Trump"	0
882	TRUMP	Oh, where can I get them?  If we ever did that, it would be like a big deal.	0
883	TRUMP	Yeah, it’s a con job.	0
884	TRUMP	And it’s not a bad term.	0
885	TRUMP	It’s not a bad term at all.	0
886	QUESTION	Are you worried —	0
887	TRUMP	I’ll tell you one thing I can say: I’ve had a lot of people talking about this to me, with respect to what’s happening, because it’s a horrible precedent.	0
888	TRUMP	I’m going to have to get other judges and other Supreme Court judges, possibly.	0
889	TRUMP	I could have a lot of the Supreme Court judges, more than two.	0
890	TRUMP	And when I called up Brett Kavanaugh — spoke to him and his family — and told them that I chose them, they were so happy and so honored.	0
891	TRUMP	It was as though — I mean, the biggest thing that’s ever happened.	0
892	TRUMP	And I understand that — U.S. Supreme Court.	0
893	TRUMP	I don’t want to be in a position where people say, "No, thanks. No, thanks. I don’t want to"	0
894	TRUMP	You know, "I spoke to somebody 38 years ago, and it may not be good"	0
895	TRUMP	We have a country to run.	0
896	TRUMP	We want the best talent in the world.	0
897	TRUMP	But I’ll tell you this:  The people that have complained to me about it the most — about what’s happening — are women.	0
898	TRUMP	Women are very angry.	0
899	TRUMP	You know, I got 52 percent with women.	0
900	TRUMP	Everyone said, "This couldn’t happen — 52 percent"	0
901	TRUMP	Women are so angry.	0
902	TRUMP	And I, frankly, think that — I think they like what the Republicans are doing, but I think they would have liked to have seen it go a lot faster.	0
903	TRUMP	But give them their day in court.	0
904	TRUMP	Let her have her day in court.	0
905	TRUMP	Let somebody else have a day in court.	0
906	TRUMP	But the ones that I find — I mean, I have men that don’t like it, but I have women that are incensed at what’s going on.	0
907	TRUMP	I’ve always said women are smarter than men.	0
908	TRUMP	I’ve said that a lot and I mean it.	0
909	TRUMP	But women are incensed at what’s going on.	0

961	QUESTION	Kurds right now, after the defeat of ISIS, are under a lot of pressure in Syria and in Iraq by many adversaries.	0
962	TRUMP	It’s true.	0
963	QUESTION	What will you do to elevate their position to support them in order — after they help the United States to defeat ISIS?	0
964	QUESTION	Thank you very much.	0
965	TRUMP	Well, we are helping them a lot and we’ve been very friendly with them.	0
966	TRUMP	And, as you know, we’ve fought side-by-side.	0
967	TRUMP	And we have defeated ISIS, essentially, a very short while ago, in the Middle East.	0
968	TRUMP	And we did it with a lot of help from the Kurds.	0
969	TRUMP	And they are — they’re great fighters.	0
970	TRUMP	You know, some people are great fighters and some people aren’t.	0
971	TRUMP	The Kurds are great fighters.	0
972	TRUMP	And they’re great, great people.	0
973	TRUMP	And we’re going to be working — we’re discussing that situation exactly right now.	0
974	QUESTION	What will you do to support them, sir, (inaudible) Syria?	0
975	TRUMP	Well, I’m just telling you, we’re going to be discussing that situation.	0
976	TRUMP	We have already started discussing that situation.	0
977	TRUMP	But we have tremendous support from the Kurds in defeating ISIS.	0
978	TRUMP	Okay?	0
979	QUESTION	And about Syria:  Sir, in your speech you did not mention —	0

986	QUESTION	Mr. President, Susan Li from Fox Business.	0
987	QUESTION	Did you reject a one-on-one meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau?	0
988	TRUMP	Yeah, I did.	0
989	QUESTION	Why?	0
990	TRUMP	Because his tariffs are too high, and he doesn’t seem to want to move, and I’ve told him, "Forget about it"	0
991	TRUMP	And frankly, we’re thinking about just taxing cars coming in from Canada.	0
992	TRUMP	That’s the motherlode.	0
993	TRUMP	That’s the big one.	0
994	TRUMP	We’re very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of Canada.	0
995	TRUMP	We don’t like their representative very much.	0
996	TRUMP	They’ve taken advantage — I love Canada, by the way.	0
997	TRUMP	I have so many friends.	0
998	TRUMP	I have everybody, and so many friends.	0
999	TRUMP	But that has nothing to do with this; I’m representing the United States.	0
1000	TRUMP	Mexico was totally — I mean, they were great.	0
1001	TRUMP	By the way, the new President has been great.	0
1002	TRUMP	The deal is done.	0
1003	TRUMP	Now, it has to go through Congress and, you know, a lot things have to happen.	0
1004	TRUMP	But we’ve done — Bob Lighthizer, who’s here someplace.	0
1005	TRUMP	Where’s Bob?	0
1006	TRUMP	Bob.	0
1007	TRUMP	Bob Lighthizer has done a great job of negotiating, as they have.	0

1009	TRUMP	It’s up to Congress.	0
1010	QUESTION	And, Mr. President —	0
1011	TRUMP	But Canada has treated us very badly.	0
1012	TRUMP	They’ve treated our farmers in Wisconsin, and New York state, and a lot of other states very badly.	0
1013	TRUMP	Dairy products — 300 percent.	1
1014	TRUMP	Three hundred percent.	1
1015	TRUMP	How do you sell a dairy product at 300 percent?	0
1016	TRUMP	The answer is:  You don’t.	0
1017	TRUMP	What it is, is a barrier.	0
1018	TRUMP	It’s — basically, they’re saying, "We don’t have any barriers. By the way, it’s 300 percent"	1
1019	TRUMP	So you don’t send it in, because you can’t compete.	0
1020	TRUMP	So Canada has a long way to go.	0
1021	TRUMP	I must be honest with you, we’re not getting along at all with their negotiators.	0
1022	TRUMP	We think their negotiators have taken advantage of our country for a long time.	0
1023	TRUMP	We had people that didn’t know what they were doing.	0
1024	TRUMP	And that’s why we had — over the last five or six years, if you average it out, we had $800 billion a year in trade losses.	0

1030	QUESTION	What does that mean for NAFTA?	0
1031	QUESTION	Will you be pulling out of NAFTA?	0
1032	TRUMP	I don’t like NAFTA.	0
1033	TRUMP	I never liked it.	0

1035	TRUMP	It’s been great for Canada.	0
1036	TRUMP	It’s been great for Mexico.	0
1037	TRUMP	Very bad for us.	0
1038	QUESTION	But will you pull out of the —	0
1039	TRUMP	I’m not going to use the name "NAFTA"	0
1040	TRUMP	I refuse to use it.	0
1041	TRUMP	I’ve seen thousands of plants and factories close.	0
1042	TRUMP	I’ve seen millions of jobs lost to auto companies that moved.	0
1043	TRUMP	I mean, Mexico has 25 percent of our auto business now because of NAFTA.	0
1044	TRUMP	Under our deal, it’s not going to happen anymore.	0
1045	TRUMP	I hate to tell you, it’s not.	0
1046	TRUMP	We’re going to keep companies.	0
1047	TRUMP	And I told the Mexicans, I said, "We have to keep companies"	0
1048	TRUMP	But they’re getting a lot, also.	0
1049	TRUMP	They’re getting other things.	0
1050	TRUMP	They’re getting a lot of good things.	0
1051	TRUMP	Mexico made a very good deal.	0
1052	TRUMP	But with Canada, it’s very tough.	0
1053	TRUMP	What we’re doing is if we made a deal with Canada — which is, you know, a good chance still.	0
1054	TRUMP	But I’m not making anything near what they want to do.	0
1055	TRUMP	We’re going to be fair.	0
1056	QUESTION	But you’re — are you going to notify Congress of pulling out of NAFTA?	0
1057	TRUMP	What we’re probably going to do is call it the "USMC"	0
1058	TRUMP	Like the United States Marine Corps, which I love.	0
1059	TRUMP	General Kelly likes it even more.	0
1060	TRUMP	Where’s General Kelly?	0
1061	TRUMP	He likes that.	0
1062	TRUMP	USMC — which would be U.S., Mexico, Canada.	0
1063	TRUMP	But it’ll probably or possibly be just "USM"	0
1064	TRUMP	It’ll be United States and Mexico.	0
1065	QUESTION	Yes or no, are you going to —	0
1066	TRUMP	Canada will come along.	0
1067	TRUMP	Now, if Canada doesn’t make a deal with us, we’re going to make a much better deal.	0
1068	TRUMP	We’re going to tax the cars that come in.	0
1069	TRUMP	We will put billions and billions of dollars into our Treasury.	0
1070	TRUMP	And frankly, we’ll be very happy because it’s actually more money than you can make, under any circumstance, with making a deal.	0
1071	TRUMP	Okay?	0
1072	TRUMP	Good job, too.	0
1073	TRUMP	You do a very good job.	0

1091	QUESTION	(Inaudible.)	0
1092	TRUMP	We have to help them.	0
1093	TRUMP	I want to help them.	0
1094	TRUMP	Go ahead, what’s next?	0

1096	TRUMP	They fought with us.	0
1097	TRUMP	They fought with us.	0
1098	TRUMP	They died with us.	0
1099	TRUMP	They died.	0

1101	TRUMP	They died for us and with us.	0
1102	TRUMP	And for themselves.	0
1103	TRUMP	They died for themselves.	0

1112	QUESTION	About Iran, Mr. President.	0
1113	QUESTION	About Iran, one question: What is your clear plan to stop Iranian influence in Iraq, in Syria, and especially in Iraqi Kurdistan?	0
1114	TRUMP	Well, I think you’ve seen that.	0
1115	TRUMP	I must tell you, it’s — I don’t mind your question because —	0
1116	QUESTION	Raheem Rashidi, from Kurdistan TV.	0
1117	QUESTION	Thank you.	0
1118	TRUMP	I think there’s been no greater change — other than maybe China, because China — unfortunately, their markets have dropped — would you say, 30 percent in the last four months, right?	0
1119	TRUMP	I think I watched you recently when you said that.	0
1120	TRUMP	I said, "I think she’s wrong. I think it’s actually 32. But that’s okay"	0
1121	TRUMP	But a lot.	0
1122	TRUMP	There’s been no — other than maybe that, but even that.	0
1123	TRUMP	Because China is a very special place.	0
1124	TRUMP	And Iran is a very special place.	0
1125	TRUMP	But I think there’s been no country that’s changed so much as Iran.	0
1126	TRUMP	In the last six months, since I took off the horrible, horrible Iran nuclear deal, as they called it — one of the dumbest deals ever made.	0
1127	TRUMP	As an example, why didn’t they take care of Yemen in the deal?	0
1128	TRUMP	Why didn’t they take care of Syria in the deal?	0
1129	TRUMP	You know what Kerry said — the reason?	0
1130	TRUMP	It was too complicated.	0
1131	TRUMP	We’re giving $150 billion, we paid $1.8 billion in cash — cash.	0
1132	TRUMP	This whole room would be filled up with hundred-dollar bills.	0
1133	TRUMP	And you’d need probably five rooms like this.	0
1134	TRUMP	But you have $1.8 billion in cash.	0
1135	TRUMP	Why didn’t we take care of Yemen?	0
1136	TRUMP	Why didn’t we take care of Syria and other?	0
1137	TRUMP	And he said, "Because it was too complicated"	0
1138	TRUMP	Well, you just gave all your cards.	0
1139	TRUMP	You gave them $150 billion.	0
1140	TRUMP	And now Yemen’s a mess, but it’s getting better.	0
1141	TRUMP	And Syria’s a mess.	0
1142	TRUMP	And I was responsible — and I hope it stays that way — when I put out on social media, a few weeks ago, about Idlib Province.	0
1143	TRUMP	I said, "Don’t do it"	0
1144	TRUMP	And I’ll tell you, it happened — where I was at a meeting with a lot of supporters, and a woman stood up and she said, "There’s a province in Syria with 3 million people. Right now, the Iranians, the Russians, and the Syrians are surrounding their province. And they’re going to kill my sister. And they’re going to kill millions of people in order to get rid of 25,000 or 35,000 terrorists or enemies of theirs"	0
1145	TRUMP	But I think we can call them terrorists.	0
1146	TRUMP	And I said, "That’s not going to happen"	0
1147	TRUMP	I didn’t hear of Idlib Province.	0
1148	TRUMP	And I came back to New York, and I picked up the failing New York Times — I hate to admit it was the New York Times, but it was the failing New York Times.	0
1149	TRUMP	And I opened it up — not on the front page, but there was a very big story.	0
1150	TRUMP	I said, "Wow, that’s the same story that the woman told me that I found hard to believe"	0
1151	TRUMP	Because why would — how would anyone do that with 3 million people?	0
1152	TRUMP	And it said that they were being surrounded, and they were going in and starting — literally, the next day, they were going to drop bombs all over the place and perhaps kill millions of people in order to get 35,000 terrorists.	0
1153	TRUMP	And I put out on social media and elsewhere — I gave Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, everybody these orders: "Don’t let it happen"	0
1154	TRUMP	I said, "Don’t let it happen"	0
1155	TRUMP	That doesn’t mean they can’t be selective.	0
1156	TRUMP	They can’t be — you know, go in and they’ve got to do what they’ve got to do with terrorists.	0
1157	TRUMP	I assume they’re terrorists.	0
1158	TRUMP	But don’t kill millions of people.	0
1159	TRUMP	And it stopped.	0
1160	TRUMP	You saw that.	0
1161	TRUMP	Nobody’s going to give me credit, but that’s okay.	0
1162	TRUMP	That’s okay.	0
1163	TRUMP	Because the people the people know.	0
1164	TRUMP	I have had more Syrians thank me for that.	0
1165	TRUMP	This was about four weeks ago, I put that out.	0
1166	TRUMP	I said, "They’re surrounding a city of 3 million people. They’re going to start bombing the city. Don’t let it happen"	0
1167	TRUMP	And I meant it, too.	0
1168	TRUMP	I meant it.	0
1169	TRUMP	And millions of people have been saved.	0
1170	TRUMP	And I gave, today, great credit to Iran.	0
1171	TRUMP	I don’t know if you heard that.	0
1172	TRUMP	I gave great credit to Iran, to Russia, and to Syria for not doing it.	0
1173	TRUMP	Now I hope it’s going to be surgical — meaning go in and do — it’s lengthy and everything else.	0
1174	TRUMP	And they possibly have to do it.	0
1175	TRUMP	But I think millions of people would have been killed.	0
1176	TRUMP	And that would have been a shame.	0
1177	TRUMP	And hopefully — and I have to tell you, Turkey has been a big help.	0
1178	TRUMP	Turkey has been great.	0
1179	TRUMP	Turkey has helped us very much with that whole situation.	0
1180	QUESTION	Mr. President.	0
1181	TRUMP	Yes.	0
1182	TRUMP	Yes.	0
1183	QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
1184	TRUMP	Good.	0
1185	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
1186	QUESTION	Touching back on Iran: Of course, this week, you put out a call to action to other countries to rally with America, to put pressure on Iran.	0
1187	QUESTION	Rouhani is still calling for the U.S. to come back into the old deal.	0
1188	QUESTION	But after meeting with world leaders this week, did you make any progress towards a potential new deal?	0
1189	TRUMP	Doesn’t matter what world leaders think on Iran.	0
1190	TRUMP	Iran’s going to come back to me and they’re going to make a good deal, I think.	0
1191	TRUMP	Maybe not.	0
1192	TRUMP	Deals — you never know.	0
1193	TRUMP	But they’re suffering greatly.	0
1194	TRUMP	They’re having riots in every city, far greater than they were during the green period with President Obama.	1
1195	TRUMP	Far greater.	0
1196	TRUMP	When President Obama stuck up for government, not the people.	1
1197	TRUMP	You probably would have had a much different Iran had he not done that.	0
1198	TRUMP	But I’m sticking up for the people.	0
1199	TRUMP	I am with the people of Iran.	0
1200	TRUMP	But here’s the thing:  They have rampant inflation.	0
1201	TRUMP	Their money is worthless.	0
1202	TRUMP	Everything is going wrong.	0
1203	TRUMP	They have riots in the street.	0
1204	TRUMP	You can’t buy bread.	0
1205	TRUMP	You can’t do anything.	0
1206	TRUMP	It’s a disaster.	0
1207	TRUMP	At some point, I think they’re going to want to come back, and they’re going to say, "Hey, can we do something?"	0
1208	TRUMP	And I’m very simple; I just don’t want them to have nuclear weapons.	0
1209	TRUMP	That’s all.	0
1210	TRUMP	Is that too much to ask?	0
1211	TRUMP	I don’t want them to have nuclear weapons.	0
1212	TRUMP	I want them to have a great economy.	0
1213	TRUMP	I want them to sell so much oil so that the oil prices — I’m not happy with OPEC.	0
1214	TRUMP	I told them, "I’m not happy with OPEC"	0
1215	TRUMP	We take care of all these people, we defend them.	0
1216	TRUMP	They wouldn’t be there for two weeks if it wasn’t for me, and the United States, and a much stronger armed forces than it was.	0
1217	TRUMP	Because our armed forces was depleted.	0
1218	TRUMP	We had old equipment.	0
1219	TRUMP	Now, we have — hey, you know better than anybody — $700 billion and $716 billion.	0
1220	TRUMP	We have the most incredible new jets and everything.	0
1221	TRUMP	We need it.	0
1222	TRUMP	Not that I want to spend it, although it is jobs.	0
1223	TRUMP	It’s all made in the United States.	0
1224	TRUMP	But Iran has to come back, and they have to talk.	0
1225	TRUMP	And I’m not doing this from strength or weakness.	0
1226	TRUMP	I’m just saying, at some point, I think they’re going to have to come back.	0
1227	TRUMP	If you look at what’s going on, companies are leaving left and right.	0
1228	TRUMP	Mercedes Benz just left.	0
1229	TRUMP	They’re all leaving.	0
1230	TRUMP	They don’t want to be in Iran.	0
1231	TRUMP	Because they have a choice: Do they want to be with Iran, or do they want to be with us?	0
1232	TRUMP	And we have, by — we picked up $10 trillion since my election.	0
1233	TRUMP	We were being caught by China.	0
1234	TRUMP	Now it’s going the other way.	0
1235	TRUMP	People can’t believe it.	0
1236	TRUMP	People have never seen this situation with China.	0
1237	TRUMP	Everything’s always been — for 20 years, "Oh, China is so great. China is so great"	0
1238	TRUMP	You don’t hear that so much anymore.	0
1239	TRUMP	I love China; I think they’re great.	0

1270	QUESTION	Just to be sure, I know you were pointing to me, but I work for PBS NewsHour.	0
1271	TRUMP	I know that.	0
1272	TRUMP	No, I know that.	0
1273	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1274	TRUMP	Okay.	0
1275	TRUMP	So, I want to ask you: Yesterday, you were talking about your administration’s accomplishments at the United Nations, and a lot of the leaders laughed.	0
1276	TRUMP	Why do you think they were laughing?	0
1277	TRUMP	Well, that’s fake news.	0
1278	QUESTION	And what was that experience like for you?	0
1279	TRUMP	Yeah.	0
1280	TRUMP	It was fake news.	0
1281	TRUMP	And it was covered that way.	0
1282	TRUMP	Okay.	0
1283	TRUMP	So, I said that, since my election, our economy has become the hottest in the world.	0
1284	TRUMP	Tax reductions, regulations, confidence levels are the highest in 18 years — really, soon to be historic.	0
1285	TRUMP	Unemployment is the lowest in the history of our country.	0
1286	TRUMP	You look at Black unemployment.	0
1287	TRUMP	You look at Asian unemployment.	0
1288	TRUMP	You look at women — 65 years.	0
1289	TRUMP	The unemployment numbers are among the best we’ve ever had ever.	0
1290	TRUMP	The numbers of new companies pouring into our country, which nobody thought was possible.	0
1291	TRUMP	And I said this.	0
1292	TRUMP	And I was in front of a large group of highly professional people, most of whom are from either other countries or the United Nations — people that aren’t big into clapping, applauding, smiling.	0
1293	TRUMP	And I heard a little rustle, as I said our country is now stronger than ever before.	0
1294	TRUMP	It’s true.	0
1295	TRUMP	I mean, it is true.	0
1296	TRUMP	And I heard a little rustle.	0
1297	TRUMP	And I said, "It’s true"	0
1298	TRUMP	And I heard smiles.	0
1299	TRUMP	And I said, "Oh, I didn’t know there there’d be that kind…"	0
1300	TRUMP	They weren’t laughing at me.	0
1301	TRUMP	They were laughing with me.	0
1302	TRUMP	We had fun.	0
1303	TRUMP	That was not laughing at me.	0
1304	TRUMP	So the fake news said, "People laughed at President Trump"	0
1305	TRUMP	They didn’t laugh at me.	0
1306	TRUMP	People had a good time with me.	0
1307	TRUMP	We were doing it together.	0
1308	TRUMP	We had a good time.	0
1309	TRUMP	They respect what I’ve done.	0
1310	TRUMP	The United States is respected again.	0
1311	TRUMP	The United States was not respected.	0
1312	TRUMP	Everybody was taking advantage of us.	0
1313	TRUMP	From jobs, and taking our companies, and not paying the price — to so many other things, even military protection.	0
1314	TRUMP	I told a number of countries over the last few days, I said, "Listen, you’re a very rich country. We protect you. Without our protection, you would have real problems. You would have real problems."	0
1315	QUESTION	And I — I want to —	0
1316	TRUMP	I said, "You should reimburse us for this protection. Why are we protecting you?"	0
1317	TRUMP	And do you want to know what they said after about two minutes of talking?	0
1318	TRUMP	They agreed with me.	0
1319	TRUMP	And you can ask this group of very talented people — they agreed with me.	0
1320	TRUMP	But they said — one of them said, "But Mr. President, nobody ever asked us for that. They never asked us for that"	0
1321	TRUMP	Nobody has ever said, "You should pay"	0
1322	TRUMP	These are really wealthy countries.	0
1323	TRUMP	I mean, I’ll be honest, I just asked Japan.	0
1324	TRUMP	I said, "We’re defending you. You’re a very wealthy country. You’re sending us millions of cars. We have a tremendous trade deficit with you. And we’re defending you, and we’re subsidizing your military with a massive amount of money."	0
1325	TRUMP	I said it to South Korea.	0
1326	TRUMP	We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea.	0
1327	TRUMP	They’re a very wealthy — these are great countries.	0
1328	TRUMP	These are very wealthy countries.	0
1329	TRUMP	I said, "Why aren’t you reimbursing us for our costs?"	0
1330	TRUMP	And you know what?	0
1331	TRUMP	They look at me, and they can’t even answer it, because there’s no answer.	0
1332	TRUMP	If they’re a poor country and they needed protection, and people were going to die, I’m all for protecting them; I don’t want 10 cents.	0
1333	TRUMP	But when wealthy countries that have massive trade surpluses with us — massive — and then on top of that, we’re paying for their military?	0
1334	TRUMP	Or we’re paying for a lot of their military?	0
1335	TRUMP	That doesn’t work.	0
1336	TRUMP	How about two more, and we’ll call it?	0
1337	QUESTION	Mr. President, really quickly.	0

1347	QUESTION	Well, can you please explain then what you’re talking about in your own false allegations?	0
1348	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
1349	TRUMP	And by the way, I think you do a very good job, but I didn’t say that.	0
1350	TRUMP	I do watch you.	0
1351	TRUMP	And I think you do a very good job.	0
1352	TRUMP	But I didn’t say that.	0
1353	QUESTION	So could you explain what you meant?	0
1354	TRUMP	I said, exactly, "I look forward to watching her"	0

1356	TRUMP	And maybe she’ll say — I could be convinced of anything.	0

1358	TRUMP	He’s a tremendous man.	0
1359	TRUMP	He’s a tremendous genius.	0
1360	TRUMP	He’s a great intellect.	0

1362	TRUMP	Is that a correct statement?	0
1363	TRUMP	Number one in his class at Yale.	0
1364	QUESTION	So you don’t feel a kinship with him?	0
1365	TRUMP	He was a great student in law.	0
1366	TRUMP	He was — you know, I’ve heard his name.	0
1367	TRUMP	I didn’t know him.	0
1368	TRUMP	Didn’t know him.	0
1369	TRUMP	Until this whole thing, I didn’t know him.	0
1370	TRUMP	But I heard his name for 10 years.	0
1371	TRUMP	And you know how I heard his name?	0
1372	TRUMP	Everybody was saying he should be on the Supreme Court.	0
1373	TRUMP	I said, "Who is he?"	0
1374	TRUMP	"His name is Brett Kavanaugh. And he should be — he’s the most brilliant person. He’s the most brilliant lawyer"	0
1375	TRUMP	They were talking about him on the Supreme Court 10 years ago.	0
1376	TRUMP	With all of that, I want to hear what she has to say.	0
1377	TRUMP	Okay?	0
1378	QUESTION	But you said that you don’t feel — but you said that you feel like there have been numerous false allegations against you, and that because of that–	0
1379	TRUMP	Oh, I’ve had many false —	0
1380	QUESTION	— you feel that you understand what he might be going through.	0
1381	TRUMP	I’ve had many false statements against me.	0
1382	TRUMP	And if the press would have reported it, I would have been very happy.	0
1383	TRUMP	I think John Roberts would tell you that — you covered the story where the women were paid to say bad things about me.	0
1384	TRUMP	Sean Hannity covered it.	0
1385	TRUMP	I will tell you, when I saw that on Sean Hannity, I actually called him.	0
1386	TRUMP	Believe it or not, I don’t speak to him very much, but I respect him.	0
1387	TRUMP	I called him.	0
1388	TRUMP	I said, "This is the biggest story. This is a big, big story"	0
1389	TRUMP	He agreed with me.	0
1390	TRUMP	The next day, I picked up the papers.	0
1391	TRUMP	There wasn’t one word about it.	0
1392	TRUMP	The next day, I watched ABC news.	0
1393	TRUMP	John, I watched NBC.	0
1394	TRUMP	I watched CBS.	0
1395	TRUMP	I didn’t watch CNN, but, next time, I’m going to.	0
1396	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1397	QUESTION	And are you okay with —	0
1398	TRUMP	I watched everything.	0
1399	TRUMP	There wasn’t one story other than Fox.	0
1400	TRUMP	And it’s a big story.	0
1401	TRUMP	It’s a shame.	0
1402	TRUMP	Okay.	0
1403	TRUMP	Enough.	0
1404	TRUMP	Thank you, though.	0
1405	QUESTION	And is it okay if I give it to the New York Times?	0

1429	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
1430	QUESTION	Mr. President, my name is Edward Szall, with TruNews.	0
1431	QUESTION	Today, you met with Bibi Netanyahu, from Israel.	0
1432	QUESTION	And you brought up, actually, that you support a two-state solution for the Palestinian-Israeli crisis there.	0
1433	TRUMP	I do.	0
1434	QUESTION	Can you give us any more preview of what this great deal, the peace deal (inaudible) —	0
1435	TRUMP	Well, I’d love to be able to make a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians.	0
1436	TRUMP	You know, my whole life, I was told that’s the toughest deal.	0
1437	TRUMP	And I disagree.	0
1438	TRUMP	I think healthcare is probably tougher, okay?	0
1439	TRUMP	You want to know the truth.	0
1440	TRUMP	But it is tough.	0
1441	TRUMP	But we’re going to take care of that, too.	0
1442	TRUMP	And that’s going to get taken care of.	0
1443	TRUMP	We’ve already taken care of a lot of it.	0
1444	TRUMP	But the whole — my life, I’ve always heard the deal between, as you know, Israel and the Palestinians, that’s like the toughest deal.	0
1445	TRUMP	Every possible thing is tough about that.	0
1446	TRUMP	I think we’re going to make a deal.	0
1447	TRUMP	I think we’re going to make a deal.	0
1448	TRUMP	So, at one of our many meetings today, I was with Bibi Netanyahu, a man who I have a lot of respect for.	0
1449	TRUMP	A man who has been extremely nice to me — very happy that I did the whole thing with Jerusalem and the embassy, which, by the way, we’re going to open in four months for less than $500,000.	0
1450	TRUMP	And the budget was over $1 billion, right?	0
1451	QUESTION	Yes.	0
1452	QUESTION	That’s correct.	0
1453	TRUMP	So we saved, let’s say, a billion dollars.	0
1454	TRUMP	That’s not so bad.	0
1455	TRUMP	And it’s open.	0
1456	TRUMP	And it’s beautiful, by the way.	0
1457	TRUMP	Jerusalem stone, one of my favorite stones.	0
1458	TRUMP	I will tell you, the question — somebody said today, "Well, this is the first news conference in a long time"	0
1459	TRUMP	I said, "What do you mean? I did like, five today"	0
1460	TRUMP	Every time I sit, I take a lot of questions from people that are screaming like maniacs in the back of the room — meaning, reporters.	0
1461	TRUMP	And one of the reporters — I won’t say that it was John Roberts that said that, I refuse.	0
1462	TRUMP	But one of the — it was, but that’s okay.	0
1463	TRUMP	Don’t feel guilty, John.	0
1464	TRUMP	But of the reporters that was screaming asked about the one-state, two-state.	0
1465	TRUMP	And I said, "I think the two-state will happen. I think it’s, in one way, more difficult because it’s a real estate deal — because you need metes and bounds, and you need lots of carveouts and lots of everything."	0
1466	TRUMP	I think it’s, in one way, more difficult because it’s a real estate deal — because you need metes and bounds, and you need lots of carveouts and lots of everything.	0
1467	TRUMP	It’s actually a little tougher deal.	0
1468	TRUMP	But in another way, it works better because you have people governing themselves.	0
1469	TRUMP	So, they asked be about that.	0
1470	TRUMP	I said, "Well, I think the two-state will happen. I think we’re going to go down the two-state road"	0
1471	TRUMP	And I’m glad I got it out.	0
1472	TRUMP	And Jared, who is so involved — he loves Israel.	0
1473	TRUMP	He loves Israel.	0
1474	TRUMP	But he’s also going to be very fair with the Palestinians.	0
1475	TRUMP	He understands it takes two people to be happy — two groups of people to be happy.	0
1476	TRUMP	Everybody has got to be happy.	0
1477	TRUMP	And that’s why it’s so tough, because there’s been so much hatred and anger for so many years.	0
1478	TRUMP	That’s what, probably, the number-one ingredient of toughness is.	0
1479	TRUMP	But they asked me — I said I think it’s going to be a two-state.	0
1480	TRUMP	And you know what I did today?	0
1481	TRUMP	By saying that, I put it out there.	0
1482	TRUMP	And if you ask most of the people in Israel, they agree with that.	0
1483	TRUMP	But nobody wanted to say it.	0
1484	TRUMP	It’s a big thing to put it out.	0
1485	TRUMP	It’s a very big thing to put it out.	0
1486	TRUMP	Now, the bottom line: If the Israelis and the Palestinians want one state, that’s okay with me.	0
1487	TRUMP	If they want two states, that’s okay with me.	0
1488	TRUMP	I’m happy if they’re happy.	0
1489	TRUMP	I’m a facilitator.	0
1490	TRUMP	I want to see if I can get a deal done so that people don’t get killed anymore.	0
1491	TRUMP	When we had — in Saudi Arabia, we had one of the great conferences in history.	0
1492	TRUMP	Many of you were there; probably all of you were there.	0
1493	TRUMP	It was one of the most beautiful two days.	0
1494	TRUMP	That, and China — two of the most incredible events I’ve ever seen.	0
1495	TRUMP	I’ve never seen anything like it.	0
1496	TRUMP	And we had, I believe, 58 Muslim countries — the leaders.	0
1497	TRUMP	The kings, the emirs, the absolute leaders from every — there was nobody in second place.	0
1498	TRUMP	They were the leaders of the whole thing.	0
1499	TRUMP	And unbeknownst to anybody else, people would come up to me, individually — it wasn’t a setup.	0
1500	TRUMP	They’d come up to me and say, "Sir, you can’t have peace in the Middle East without peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians"	0
1501	TRUMP	I said, "Why? What difference? Why does that matter so much?"	0
1502	TRUMP	They said, "It just is impossible to make peace in the Middle East unless you have between the Israelis…"	0
1503	TRUMP	So, I heard that from one — the King of Saudi Arabia, who is a great guy — King Salman.	0
1504	TRUMP	And then, somebody else came up.	0
1505	TRUMP	And he wasn’t told, "Oh, go up and say it"	0
1506	TRUMP	I know where they’re coming from.	0
1507	TRUMP	And I must have had 12 leaders say it.	0
1508	TRUMP	And they just said it.	0
1509	TRUMP	And I started to realize that peace between Israel and the Palestinians, for the Middle East, is a very important thing.	0
1510	TRUMP	And we’re trying very hard to get it.	0
1511	TRUMP	I think, probably, two-state is more likely.	0
1512	TRUMP	But you know what?	0
1513	TRUMP	If they do a single, if they do a double, I’m okay with it if they’re both happy.	0
1514	TRUMP	If they’re both happy, I’m okay with either.	0
1515	TRUMP	I think the two-state is more likely.	0
1516	TRUMP	Okay, how about one — go ahead.	0
1517	QUESTION	New York Times?	0
1518	QUESTION	New York Times?	0
1519	TRUMP	Oh, okay.	0
1520	QUESTION	Thank you, sir.	0
1521	TRUMP	I would have gotten bad story in the New York Times.	0
1522	TRUMP	But I will anyways, so I guess it doesn’t matter.	0
1523	QUESTION	We’re — we’re kind of, uh —	0
1524	TRUMP	Okay, we’ll do you after that.	0
1525	QUESTION	We’re kind of, uh —	0
1526	TRUMP	And then we’ll call it quits.	0
1527	QUESTION	We’re kind of thriving, not failing these days.	0
1528	TRUMP	You’re doing very well.	0
1529	QUESTION	Yeah.	0
1530	TRUMP	Say, "Thank you, Mr. Trump"	0
1531	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1532	QUESTION	(Laughs).	0
1533	QUESTION	I think I’ll stop short of that.	0
1534	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1535	TRUMP	I wonder how you do — you know, all my life, I’ve had very few stories — but I’ve had some on the front page of the New York Times.	0
1536	TRUMP	Now, I think I think I average about three or four a day, right?	0
1537	QUESTION	That is —	0
1538	TRUMP	And, of the three or four, they’re all negative.	0
1539	TRUMP	No matter what I do, they’re negative.	0
1540	TRUMP	But you know what?	0
1541	TRUMP	That’s okay.	0
1542	TRUMP	I still love the paper.	0
1543	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
1544	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1545	QUESTION	I wanted to come back to China, because I think what you announced today was really important.	0
1546	TRUMP	I agree.	0
1547	QUESTION	You talk about this friendship you have with Xi Jinping, and yet, essentially, what you did today is accused his government —	0
1548	TRUMP	That’s right.	0
1549	QUESTION	— of interfering in our internal affairs —	0
1550	TRUMP	That’s right.	0
1551	QUESTION	— subverting our Democratic process, and doing it to hurt you, the Republican Party —	0
1552	TRUMP	Doing it to help them.	0
1553	QUESTION	— and your backers.	0
1554	TRUMP	You know what?	0
1555	TRUMP	Yeah.	0
1556	TRUMP	Doing it to help them.	0
1557	QUESTION	So how can a guy who does that be your friend?	0
1558	TRUMP	I think that we are able to — and maybe he’s not anymore.	0
1559	TRUMP	I’ll be honest with you, I think we had a very good friendship.	0
1560	TRUMP	I think we had a very good relationship; we understand each other.	0
1561	TRUMP	They are doing studies on Donald Trump.	0
1562	TRUMP	They’re trying to figure it all out because this has never happened to them before.	0
1563	TRUMP	It’s never happened.	0
1564	TRUMP	Think of it, you’ve never seen — you’ve covered very well — you’ve never seen this happen.	0
1565	TRUMP	They’re having big problems.	0
1566	TRUMP	I don’t want them to have problems, but they got to make a fair deal.	0
1567	TRUMP	Just like Canada has got to make a fair deal.	0
1568	TRUMP	I believe that he and I have a very good chemistry together.	0
1569	TRUMP	And I can tell you that about many leaders.	0
1570	TRUMP	I can also tell you a few where I don’t feel I’ll ever have a chemistry with them.	0
1571	TRUMP	I don’t want to have a chemistry with them.	0
1572	TRUMP	And for those people, I’ll have Pompeo, Nikki, Bolton, Jared.	0
1573	TRUMP	I can go — our general; I’ll have our general.	0
1574	TRUMP	Or if they can’t do it, I’ll have Sarah Huckabee do it.	0
1575	TRUMP	Right?	0
1576	TRUMP	But for the most part, I have very good — very good with Prime Minister Abe.	0
1577	TRUMP	Very good with President Moon.	0
1578	TRUMP	By the way, what President Moon said last night — I know you won’t report it — but Bret Baier interviewed him last night and he asked him about me.	0
1579	TRUMP	I can’t say — because you would say I’m too braggadocios — but what he said about me last night was an unbelievable thing.	0
1580	TRUMP	Couldn’t have happened without President Trump, and it never would happen without President Trump. TRUMP And nobody else could do it	0
1581	TRUMP	You know, I mean, you’ll take a look.	0
1582	TRUMP	But I will tell you, China is very special.	0
1583	TRUMP	Very special.	0
1584	TRUMP	They’re incredible people.	0
1585	TRUMP	It’s an incredible country.	0
1586	TRUMP	What they’ve done is unbelievable.	0
1587	QUESTION	How would —	0
1588	TRUMP	And it all started with the WTO.	0
1589	TRUMP	It was a defective deal.	0
1590	TRUMP	And it all started — without the WTO, China is not China as we know it today.	0
1591	TRUMP	And then it started also by — our people that are standing right in this position, that are in the Oval Office — another way of saying it — allowed them to get away with murder.	0
1592	TRUMP	Allowed a lot of countries to get away with murder.	0
1593	TRUMP	I think we still probably have a very good relationship.	0
1594	TRUMP	But you know what?	0
1595	TRUMP	In honor of you, I will, tomorrow, make a call to him.	0
1596	TRUMP	Say, "Hey, how you doing?"	0
1597	TRUMP	Okay?	0
1598	QUESTION	Can I — can I just ask —	0
1599	TRUMP	You don’t mind paying billions of dollars a month in tariffs.	0
1600	QUESTION	I just had two small follow-ups.	0
1601	QUESTION	One is, how would you compare the level of interference you see today from the Chinese to what Russia did in 2016?	0
1602	TRUMP	Well, I think it’s different.	0
1603	TRUMP	If you look at the Des Moines Register, I mean, they have ads that are made to look like editorials.	0
1604	TRUMP	Saying about, "Oh, you got to stop Trump. You got to stop him. You got to vote against him"	1
1605	TRUMP	My farmers are so incredible.	0
1606	TRUMP	These are patriots.	0
1607	TRUMP	You know, on a network that doesn’t like me very much — which is most of them — but a network that didn’t — doesn’t really treat me very good, they interviewed farmers.	0
1608	TRUMP	And they got hurt because, you know, all of a sudden China stops buying.	0
1609	TRUMP	By the way, they’ve started buying again.	0
1610	TRUMP	I don’t know if you’ve noticed.	0
1611	TRUMP	And soybeans are going up, and things are going up.	0
1612	TRUMP	And we’ve had very little hurt from what I’ve done.	0
1613	TRUMP	In fact, the markets have gone up.	0
1614	TRUMP	And the farmers are going to do great.	0
1615	TRUMP	But, ultimately — but they had farmers, and these guys are amazing; I love them.	0
1616	TRUMP	And they voted for me and they love me.	0
1617	TRUMP	And they said, "We don’t care if we get hurt. He’s doing the right thing"	0
1618	TRUMP	And, you know, a lot of people — it’s a complex game.	0
1619	TRUMP	A lot of people don’t know exactly what it is.	0
1620	TRUMP	They don’t know how to define "tariff"	0
1621	TRUMP	They don’t know it is really different than a tax, although it’s getting close.	0
1622	TRUMP	But they know that for the first time in many, many years, they have a President that’s fighting for them; that’s not letting their jobs be taken to other countries; that’s not allowing the kind of abuse that we — I mean, when you look at what happened, as an example, with NAFTA.	0
1623	TRUMP	And for years — because it was never changed — NAFTA was defective deal the day it was signed.	0
1624	TRUMP	You know why?	0
1625	TRUMP	Because they had a VAT tax of 17 percent and nobody from this country knew that.	1
1626	TRUMP	And by the time they found out, which was about a week later, nobody went and changed it.	0
1627	TRUMP	So you went many years and they never changed it.	0
1628	TRUMP	There was a VAT tax that Mexico got.	0
1629	TRUMP	So we were 17 or 16 points behind, before we even started.	0
1630	TRUMP	NAFTA was a horrible thing.	0
1631	TRUMP	So the farmers and — by the way, the steel workers — you know, I stopped the dumping.	0
1632	TRUMP	The dumping was horrible.	0
1633	TRUMP	And now if they want to dump, that’s okay, but they’ve got to pay the United States of America 25 percent on everything they dump.	0
1634	TRUMP	That’s okay.	0
1635	TRUMP	But as I told you before, steel is doing phenomenally well.	0
1636	TRUMP	But the farmers say, "This man is fighting for us. No President has ever fought for us before"	0
1637	TRUMP	And you really have to study what’s happened over the 15 years with the farm.	0
1638	TRUMP	The farmers have been decimated over a 15-year period.	0
1639	TRUMP	They’ve been decimated.	0
1640	TRUMP	The farmers are going to come out great.	0
1641	TRUMP	These are great people.	0
1642	TRUMP	They’re great, great patriots.	0
1643	TRUMP	I think we should finish with that one.	0
1644	TRUMP	Is that okay?	0
1645	TRUMP	(CROSSTALK)	0
1646	TRUMP	Okay.	0
1647	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
1648	TRUMP	Let’s go.	0
1649	TRUMP	Fast.	0
1650	QUESTION	Sure.	0
1651	TRUMP	I always like — always like to finish with a good one.	0
1652	TRUMP	Elton John said, "When you hit that last tune and it’s good, don’t go back"	0

1655	TRUMP	They do great.	0
1656	TRUMP	They’re great.	0
1657	TRUMP	They hit the last tune and everyone goes crazy.	0
1658	TRUMP	Then they go back for an encore, right?	0
1659	TRUMP	And they don’t hit it.	0
1660	TRUMP	And they leave — everyone leaves.	0
1661	TRUMP	They said, "That wasn’t a very good concert, was it?"	0
1662	TRUMP	Let’s go.	0
1663	QUESTION	Well, I’ll ask you one final question —	0
1664	TRUMP	You — don’t make me wrong.	0
1665	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
1666	QUESTION	— ahead of tomorrow’s hearing.	0

1669	TRUMP	Say it again.	0
1670	QUESTION	About the hearing tomorrow.	0
1671	TRUMP	Yes.	0
1672	QUESTION	You were asked earlier in the news conference by my friend from Sky News about the message that you are sending to —	0
1673	TRUMP	Yes.	0
1674	QUESTION	— the women of the country.	0
1675	TRUMP	Right.	0
1676	QUESTION	What about the message that you may be sending to young men?	0
1677	QUESTION	You’re a father.	0
1678	QUESTION	What does this moment that we’re in — the cultural moment —	0
1679	TRUMP	It’s a very big cultural moment.	0
1680	QUESTION	Right.	0
1681	QUESTION	So what messages do you for young men of America?	0
1682	TRUMP	It’s a very big — it’s also — you’re right.	0
1683	TRUMP	I think it’s a great question.	0
1684	TRUMP	This is a very big moment for our country because you have a man who is very outstanding, but he’s got very strong charges against him — probably charges that nobody is going to be able be — to prove.	0
1685	TRUMP	So I could have you chosen for a position.	0
1686	TRUMP	I could have you, or you, or you — anybody.	0
1687	TRUMP	And somebody could say things.	0
1688	TRUMP	And it’s happened to me many times, where false statements are made.	0
1689	TRUMP	And honestly, nobody knows who to believe.	0
1690	TRUMP	I could pick another Supreme Court judge — Justice.	0
1691	TRUMP	I could pick another one.	0
1692	TRUMP	Another one.	0
1693	TRUMP	Another one.	0
1694	TRUMP	This could go on forever.	0
1695	TRUMP	Somebody could come and say, "Thirty years ago, twenty-five years ago, ten years ago, five years ago, he did a horrible thing to me. He did this. He did that. He did that."	0
1696	TRUMP	And honestly, it’s a very dangerous period in our country.	0
1697	TRUMP	And it’s being perpetrated by some very evil people.	0
1698	TRUMP	Some of them are Democrats, I must say.	0
1699	TRUMP	Because some of them know that this is just a game that they’re playing.	0
1700	TRUMP	It’s a con game.	0
1701	TRUMP	It’s at the highest level.	0
1702	TRUMP	We’re talking about the United States Supreme Court.	0
1703	TRUMP	This can go on forever.	0
1704	TRUMP	I can pick five other people.	0
1705	TRUMP	At a certain point, the people are going to say, "No, thank you"	0
1706	TRUMP	This is the most coveted job, probably, in the world.	0
1707	TRUMP	And you know what?	0
1708	TRUMP	I would honestly say — because I interviewed great people for this job.	0
1709	TRUMP	He’s great, but I interviewed other great people for this job.	0
1710	TRUMP	I could conceivably imagine going to one of them and saying, "It’s too bad what happened to this wonderful man, but I’m going to choose you, number two. I want you to go"	0
1711	TRUMP	And I could conceivably be turned down by somebody that desperately wanted this job two months ago.	0

1714	QUESTION	Right.	0
1715	TRUMP	There’s nothing beyond Supreme Court; this is beyond Supreme Court.	0
1716	TRUMP	This has everything to do with our country.	0
1717	TRUMP	When you are guilty until proven innocent, it’s just not supposed to be that way.	0
1718	TRUMP	Always I heard, "You’re innocent until proven guilty"	0
1719	TRUMP	I’ve heard this for so long, and it’s such a beautiful phrase.	0
1720	TRUMP	In this case, you’re guilty until proven innocent.	0
1721	TRUMP	I think that is a very, very dangerous standard for our country.	0
1722	TRUMP	With that being said, I look forward to what she has to say.	0
1723	TRUMP	I also look very forward to what Judge Kavanaugh has to say.	0
1724	TRUMP	I think it’s going to be a very, very important day in the history of our country.	0
