1	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
2	TRUMP	I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for Secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr.	0
3	TRUMP	Alex Acosta.	0
4	TRUMP	He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student.	0
5	TRUMP	Former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito.	0
6	TRUMP	And he has had a tremendous career.	0
7	TRUMP	He’s a member, and has been a member, of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed — did very, very well.	0
8	TRUMP	And so Alex, I’ve wished him the best.	0
9	TRUMP	We just spoke.	0
10	TRUMP	And he’s going to be — I think he’ll be a tremendous Secretary of Labor.	0
11	TRUMP	And also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved — weeks late, I have to say that.	0
12	TRUMP	Weeks, weeks late.	0
13	TRUMP	Office of Management and Budget.	0
14	TRUMP	And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition.	0
15	TRUMP	Paul Singer has just left.	0
16	TRUMP	As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump, or, as they say, "Never Trump." And Paul just left and he’s given us his total support.	0
17	TRUMP	And it’s all about unification.	0
18	TRUMP	We’re unifying the party, and hopefully we’re going to be able to unify the country.	0
19	TRUMP	It’s very important to me.	0
20	TRUMP	I’ve been talking about that for a long time, but it’s very, very important to me.	0
21	TRUMP	So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office.	0
22	TRUMP	He was a very strong opponent, and now he’s a very strong ally.	0
23	TRUMP	And I appreciate that.	0
24	TRUMP	I think I’ll say a few words, and then we’ll take some questions.	0
25	TRUMP	And I had this time — we’ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible.	0
26	TRUMP	Just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening.	0
27	TRUMP	And we’ve done some really good work.	0
28	TRUMP	We’re very proud of that.	0
29	TRUMP	And then right after that, you prepare yourselves and we’ll do some questions — unless you have no questions.	0
30	TRUMP	That’s always a possibility.	0
31	TRUMP	I’m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration.	0
32	TRUMP	We have made incredible progress.	0
33	TRUMP	I don’t think there’s ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what we’ve done.	0
34	TRUMP	A new Rasmussen poll, in fact — because the people get it; much of the media doesn’t get it.	0
35	TRUMP	They actually get it, but they don’t write it — let’s put it that way.	0
36	TRUMP	But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up.	0
37	TRUMP	The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know.	0
38	TRUMP	And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is — to me means something much different than it used to.	0
39	TRUMP	It used to mean, oh, that’s good.	0
40	TRUMP	Now it means that’s good for jobs.	0
41	TRUMP	Very different.	0
42	TRUMP	Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league — Ford, General Motors, so many of them.	0
43	TRUMP	I’m making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which is an honor to have you this morning, because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve.	0
44	TRUMP	And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that’s possible.	0
45	TRUMP	Maybe it’s not, and that’s okay too.	0
46	TRUMP	Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.	0
47	TRUMP	The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people — tremendous disservice.	0
48	TRUMP	We have to talk about it to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control.	0
49	TRUMP	The level of dishonesty is out of control.	0
50	TRUMP	I ran for President to represent the citizens of our country.	0
51	TRUMP	I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well.	0
52	TRUMP	I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what we’re doing is we’re talking about the power structure, we’re talking about its entrenchment.	0
53	TRUMP	As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort — not all the time — and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they’re honest and fantastic.	0
54	TRUMP	But much of it is not — the distortion.	0
55	TRUMP	And we’ll talk about it, and you’ll be able to ask me questions about it.	0
56	TRUMP	But we’re not going to let it happen, because I’m here again to take my message straight to the people.	0
57	TRUMP	As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy.	0
58	TRUMP	To be honest, I inherited a mess — it’s a mess — at home and abroad.	0
59	TRUMP	A mess.	0
60	TRUMP	Jobs are pouring out of the country.	1
61	TRUMP	You see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places — low-pay, low-wages.	0
62	TRUMP	Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look.	0
63	TRUMP	The Middle East, a disaster.	0
64	TRUMP	North Korea — we’ll take care of it, folks.	0
65	TRUMP	We’re going to take care of it all.	0
66	TRUMP	I just want to let you know I inherited a mess.	0
67	TRUMP	Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges.	0
68	TRUMP	On foreign affairs, we’ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders — much of it you’ve covered — to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many.	0
69	TRUMP	We’ve had great conversations with the United Kingdom — and meetings — Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada.	0
70	TRUMP	Really, really productive conversations.	0
71	TRUMP	I would say far more productive than you would understand.	0
72	TRUMP	We’ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs.	0
73	TRUMP	It’s very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.	0
74	TRUMP	I have directed our defense community, headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis — he’s over there now, working very hard — to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world.	0
75	TRUMP	It used to be a small group, and now it’s in large sections of the world.	0
76	TRUMP	They’ve spread like cancer.	0
77	TRUMP	ISIS has spread like cancer.	0
78	TRUMP	Another mess I inherited.	0
79	TRUMP	And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who’s totally taken advantage of our previous administration.	0
80	TRUMP	And they’re the world’s top sponsor of terrorism.	0
81	TRUMP	And we’re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved.	0
82	TRUMP	And it’s not properly solved now.	0
83	TRUMP	It’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody.	0
84	TRUMP	I’ve ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military.	0
85	TRUMP	I’ve had great support from the Senate.	0
86	TRUMP	I’ve had great support from Congress generally.	0
87	TRUMP	We’ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military.	0
88	TRUMP	And I will tell you that is my — I would be so happy if we never had to use it.	0
89	TRUMP	But our country will never have had a military like the military we’re about to build and rebuild.	0
90	TRUMP	We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don’t have the right equipment.	0
91	TRUMP	And their equipment is old.	0
92	TRUMP	I used it, I talked about it at every stop.	0
93	TRUMP	Depleted — it’s depleted.	0
94	TRUMP	It won’t be depleted for long.	0
95	TRUMP	And I think one of the reasons I’m standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.	0
96	TRUMP	We have to have strong law enforcement also.	0
97	TRUMP	So we do not go abroad in the search of war.	0
98	TRUMP	We really are searching for peace, but it’s peace through strength.	0
99	TRUMP	At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years.	0
100	TRUMP	In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people.	0
101	TRUMP	These are campaign promises.	0
102	TRUMP	Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders.	0
103	TRUMP	Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half — strong borders.	0
104	TRUMP	They’re so surprised — "oh, you’re having strong borders."	0
105	TRUMP	One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected.	0
106	TRUMP	Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else.	0
107	TRUMP	They lie to the American people in order to get elected.	0
108	TRUMP	Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular, but they’re necessary for security and for other reasons.	0
109	TRUMP	And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians.	0
110	TRUMP	I’m here following through on what I pledged to do.	0
111	TRUMP	That’s all I’m doing.	0
112	TRUMP	I put it out before the American people.	0
113	TRUMP	Got 306 Electoral College votes.	1
114	TRUMP	I wasn’t supposed to get 222.	0
115	TRUMP	They said there’s no way to get 222; 230 is impossible.	0
116	TRUMP	Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable.	0
117	TRUMP	We got 306 because people came out and voted like they’ve never seen before.	0
118	TRUMP	So that’s the way it goes.	0
119	TRUMP	I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.	1
120	TRUMP	In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they’re not happy about it for whatever reason.	0
121	TRUMP	But a lot of people are happy about it.	0
122	TRUMP	In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida, five o’clock on Saturday, and I heard — just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there.	0
123	TRUMP	I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos.	0
124	TRUMP	Chaos!	0
125	TRUMP	Yet, it is the exact opposite.	0
126	TRUMP	This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my Cabinet approved, and they’re outstanding people.	0
127	TRUMP	Like Senator Dan Coates whose there — one of the most respected men of the Senate — he can’t get approved.	0
128	TRUMP	How do you not approve him?	0
129	TRUMP	He’s been a colleague, highly respected — brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it — but waiting for approval.	0
130	TRUMP	So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about, and we can’t let that happen.	0
131	TRUMP	So if the Democrats, who have — all you have to do is look at where they are right now — the only thing they can do is delay, because they’ve screwed things up royally, believe me.	0
132	TRUMP	Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time.	0
133	TRUMP	I just got here.	0
134	TRUMP	I got here with no Cabinet.	0
135	TRUMP	Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.	0
136	TRUMP	So we’ll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming.	0
137	TRUMP	We’ve withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
138	TRUMP	We’re going to make trade deals, but we’re going to have one-on-one deals — bilateral.	0
139	TRUMP	We’re going to have one-on-one deals.	0
140	TRUMP	We’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing, and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plants, equipment, roads, bridges, factories.	0
141	TRUMP	People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory.	0
142	TRUMP	They go in for a permit — it’s many, many years.	0
143	TRUMP	And then at the end of the process — they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense — and at the end of the process, they get rejected.	0
144	TRUMP	Now, they may be rejected with me, but it’s going to be a quick rejection.	0
145	TRUMP	It’s not going to take years.	0
146	TRUMP	But mostly, it’s going to be an acceptance.	0
147	TRUMP	We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs.	0
148	TRUMP	We don’t want the jobs going to other countries.	0
149	TRUMP	We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers.	0
150	TRUMP	We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.	0
151	TRUMP	We’ve issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.	0
152	TRUMP	Makes sense.	0
153	TRUMP	Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have.	0
154	TRUMP	If you go to other countries and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and they’re a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have.	0
155	TRUMP	And I want regulations because I want safety, I want all environmental situations to be taken properly care of.	0
156	TRUMP	It’s very important to me.	0
157	TRUMP	But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.	0
158	TRUMP	We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence.	0
159	TRUMP	We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation — take a look at Chicago and others — taking place right now in our inner cities.	0
160	TRUMP	Horrible.	0
161	TRUMP	We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs.	0
162	TRUMP	We’re becoming a drug-infested nation.	0
163	TRUMP	Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and we’re not going to let it happen any longer.	0
164	TRUMP	We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe, and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border.	0
165	TRUMP	Met with General, now Secretary, Kelly yesterday and we’re starting that process.	0
166	TRUMP	And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me.	0
167	TRUMP	The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government.	0
168	TRUMP	And we’re going to have a wall that works.	0
169	TRUMP	We’re not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke.	0
170	TRUMP	We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we’ve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border.	0
171	TRUMP	No more release, no matter who you are — release.	0
172	TRUMP	We’ve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety.	0
173	TRUMP	We are saving American lives every single day.	0
174	TRUMP	The court system has not made it easy for us.	0
175	TRUMP	And we’ve even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many.	0
176	TRUMP	We’ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.	0
177	TRUMP	Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judge’s, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe — including reporters safe — and is vigorously defending this lawful order.	0
178	TRUMP	I will not back down from defending our country.	0
179	TRUMP	I got elected on defense of our country.	0
180	TRUMP	And I keep my campaign promises.	0
181	TRUMP	And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result.	0
182	TRUMP	They already are.	0
183	TRUMP	I can tell you that.	0
184	TRUMP	Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places.	0
185	TRUMP	In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number.	1
186	TRUMP	I’ve heard 80 percent — I find that hard to believe; that’s just a number I heard — that they’re overturned 80 percent of the time.	0
187	TRUMP	I think that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is, frankly, in turmoil.	0
188	TRUMP	But we are appealing that and we are going further.	0
189	TRUMP	We’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that.	0
190	TRUMP	At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done some time next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.	0
191	TRUMP	We’ve also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines — thousands and thousands of jobs — and put new "Buy American" measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines.	0
192	TRUMP	In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen.	0
193	TRUMP	We want them to use American steel.	0
194	TRUMP	And they’re willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along.	0
195	TRUMP	Even this order was drawn and they didn’t say that.	0
196	TRUMP	And I’m reading the order, I’m saying, why aren’t we using American steel?	0
197	TRUMP	And they said, that’s a good idea.	0
198	TRUMP	We put it in.	0
199	TRUMP	To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C.	0
200	TRUMP	I’ve started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.	0
201	TRUMP	We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
202	TRUMP	Obamacare is a disaster, folks.	0
203	TRUMP	It’s a disaster.	0
204	TRUMP	You can say, oh, Obamacare — I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they’re not the Republican people that our representatives are representing.	0
205	TRUMP	So we’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back.	0
206	TRUMP	We’re bringing our jobs back to this country big league.	0
207	TRUMP	It’s already happening, but big league.	0
208	TRUMP	I’ve also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats.	0
209	TRUMP	You’ve seen what they’ve done over the last long number of years.	0
210	TRUMP	That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history.	0
211	TRUMP	You look at Rex Tillerson — he’s out there negotiating right now.	0
212	TRUMP	General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly.	0
213	TRUMP	We have great, great people.	0
214	TRUMP	Mick is with us now.	0
215	TRUMP	We have great people.	0
216	TRUMP	Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.	0
217	TRUMP	Now, look, fair trade — not free — fair.	0
218	TRUMP	If a country is taking advantage of us, we’re not going to let that happen anymore.	0
219	TRUMP	Every country takes advantage of us, almost.	0
220	TRUMP	I may be able to find a couple that don’t.	0
221	TRUMP	But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.	0
222	TRUMP	Jobs have already started to surge.	0
223	TRUMP	Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.	1
224	TRUMP	Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs.	1
225	TRUMP	They were with me a week ago.	0
226	TRUMP	You know — you were here.	0
227	TRUMP	General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave.	0
228	TRUMP	And if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left.	0
229	TRUMP	And these jobs and these things that I’m announcing would never have come here.	0
230	TRUMP	Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with.	1
231	TRUMP	And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.	1
232	TRUMP	Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives.	1
233	TRUMP	There will be many, many more.	0
234	TRUMP	Many more.	0
235	TRUMP	These are a few that we’re naming.	0
236	TRUMP	Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades — decades and decades and decades, folks.	0
237	TRUMP	And we’re not going to let that happen anymore.	0
238	TRUMP	Not going to let it happen.	0
239	TRUMP	And one more thing.	0
240	TRUMP	I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution — highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats — you may not see that, but he’ll get there one way or the other.	0
241	TRUMP	But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.	0
242	TRUMP	This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country.	0
243	TRUMP	Again, I say it — there has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time.	0
244	TRUMP	And we haven’t even started the big work that starts early next week.	0
245	TRUMP	Some very big things are going to be announced next week.	0
246	TRUMP	So we’re just getting started.	0
247	TRUMP	We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m.	0
248	TRUMP	I hope to see you there.	0
249	TRUMP	And with that, I’d just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions.	0
250	TRUMP	Mara.	0
251	TRUMP	Mara, go ahead.	0
252	TRUMP	You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.	0
253	QUESTION	Did you fire Mike Flynn?	0
254	TRUMP	Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation.	0
255	TRUMP	He respectfully gave it.	0
256	TRUMP	He is a man who — there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today.	0
257	TRUMP	And I was not happy with the way that information was given.	0
258	TRUMP	He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw.	0
259	TRUMP	What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally.	0
260	TRUMP	That’s the real problem.	0
261	TRUMP	And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it.	0
262	TRUMP	In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this — they know nothing about it.	0
263	TRUMP	They weren’t in Russia, they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call.	0
264	TRUMP	It’s all fake news.	0
265	TRUMP	It’s all fake news.	0
266	TRUMP	The nice thing is I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara — and I think it’s very important — the illegal giving out classified information.	0
267	TRUMP	And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much.	0
268	TRUMP	I’ll give you an example.	0
269	TRUMP	I called, as you know, Mexico.	0
270	TRUMP	It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico.	0
271	TRUMP	And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, that’s — I spoke to the President of Mexico, had a good call.	0
272	TRUMP	All of a sudden it’s out for the world to see.	0
273	TRUMP	It’s supposed to be secret.	0
274	TRUMP	It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case.	0
275	TRUMP	Same thing with Australia.	0
276	TRUMP	All of a sudden people are finding out exactly what took place.	0
277	TRUMP	The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn.	0
278	TRUMP	Everybody saw this, and I’m saying — the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information that’s classified?	0
279	TRUMP	How do they do it?	0
280	TRUMP	You know why?	0
281	TRUMP	Because it’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves.	0
282	TRUMP	But, more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves.	0
283	TRUMP	Really ashamed.	0
284	TRUMP	Yes, go ahead.	0
285	QUESTION	Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks?	0
286	TRUMP	Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don’t think he did anything wrong.	0
287	TRUMP	If anything, he did something right.	0
288	TRUMP	He was coming into office, he looked at the information.	0
289	TRUMP	He said, huh, that’s fine, that’s what they’re supposed to do.	0
290	TRUMP	They’re supposed to be — and he didn’t just call Russia.	0
291	TRUMP	He called and spoke to, both ways — I think there were 30-some-odd countries.	0
292	TRUMP	He’s doing the job.	0
293	TRUMP	You know, he was just doing his job.	0
294	TRUMP	The thing is he didn’t tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didn’t remember.	0
295	TRUMP	So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me.	0
296	TRUMP	And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.	0
297	TRUMP	But he didn’t tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didn’t remember.	0
298	TRUMP	And that just wasn’t acceptable to me.	0
299	TRUMP	Yes.	0
300	QUESTION	President Trump, since you brought up Russia, I’m looking for some clarification here.	0
301	QUESTION	During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence?	0
302	QUESTION	And if so, what was the nature of those conversations?	0
303	TRUMP	Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday.	0
304	TRUMP	And it was very much discredited, as you know.	0
305	TRUMP	It was — it’s a joke.	0
306	TRUMP	And the people mentioned in the story — I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia.	0
307	TRUMP	They weren’t even a part, really — I mean, they were such a minor part — I hadn’t spoken to them.	0
308	TRUMP	I think the one person, I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him.	0
309	TRUMP	I don’t think I’ve ever met him.	0
310	TRUMP	And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time.	0
311	TRUMP	I don’t think I ever met him.	0
312	TRUMP	Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him.	0
313	TRUMP	I didn’t talk to him, ever.	0
314	TRUMP	And he thought it was a joke.	0
315	TRUMP	The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call.	0
316	TRUMP	Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera.	0
317	TRUMP	And the other person, people knew that he’d represented various countries, but I don’t think he represented Russia — but knew that he represented various countries.	0
318	TRUMP	That’s what he does.	0
319	TRUMP	I mean, people know that.	0
320	TRUMP	That’s Mr. Manafort, who’s, by the way — who’s, by the way, a respected man.	0
321	TRUMP	He’s a respected man.	0
322	TRUMP	But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine government, or somebody.	0
323	TRUMP	But everybody — people knew that.	0
324	TRUMP	Everybody knew that.	0
325	TRUMP	So these people — and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia.	0
326	TRUMP	And he said that very forcefully.	0
327	TRUMP	I saw his statement.	0
328	TRUMP	He said it very forcefully.	0
329	TRUMP	Most of the papers don’t print it because that’s not good for their stories.	0
330	TRUMP	So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it.	0
331	TRUMP	And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia.	0
332	TRUMP	I have no loans in Russia.	0
333	TRUMP	I don’t have any deals in Russia.	0
334	TRUMP	President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.	0
335	TRUMP	He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific.	0
336	TRUMP	But so did many other leaders — almost all other leaders from almost all other countries.	0
337	TRUMP	So that’s the extent.	0
338	TRUMP	Russia is fake news.	0
339	TRUMP	Russia — this is fake news put out by the media.	0
340	TRUMP	The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they’re there — because we have our new people going in place right now.	0
341	TRUMP	As you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA.	0
342	TRUMP	James Comey at FBI.	0
343	TRUMP	Dan Coats is waiting to be approved.	0
344	TRUMP	I mean, he is a senator, and a highly respected one.	0
345	TRUMP	And he’s still waiting to be approved.	0
346	TRUMP	But our new people are going in.	0
347	TRUMP	And just while you’re at, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New Times’s story yesterday.	0
348	TRUMP	And it talked about — you saw it, front page.	0
349	TRUMP	So, Director of National Intelligence just put out — acting — a statement: "Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community" — this was just given to us — "is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true."	0
350	TRUMP	So they took this front-page story out of The Wall Street Journal — top — and they just wrote the story is not true.	0
351	TRUMP	And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest — because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media.	0
352	TRUMP	I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.	0
353	TRUMP	But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media.	0
354	TRUMP	How do they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me?	0
355	TRUMP	Or how do they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?	0
356	TRUMP	That was like that story they wrote about the women and me — front page.	0
357	TRUMP	Big massive story.	0
358	TRUMP	And it was nasty.	0
359	TRUMP	And then they called.	0
360	TRUMP	They said, "We never said that. We like Mr. Trump."	0
361	TRUMP	They called up my office — we like Mr. Trump; we never said that.	0
362	TRUMP	And it was totally — they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you — totally misrepresented.	0
363	TRUMP	I said, give us a retraction.	0
364	TRUMP	They never gave us a retraction.	0
365	TRUMP	And, frankly, I then went on to other things.	0
366	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
367	QUESTION	Mr. President —	0
368	TRUMP	You okay?	0
369	QUESTION	I am.	0
370	QUESTION	Just wanted to get untangled.	0
371	QUESTION	Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes.	0
372	QUESTION	In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008.	0
373	TRUMP	Well, I’m talking about Republican.	0
374	TRUMP	Yes.	0
375	QUESTION	President Obama, 332.	0
376	QUESTION	George H.W.	0
377	QUESTION	Bush, 426 when he won as President.	0
378	QUESTION	So why should Americans trust —	0
379	TRUMP	Well, no, I was told — I was given that information.	0
380	TRUMP	I don’t know.	0
381	TRUMP	I was just given.	0
382	TRUMP	We had a very, very big margin.	0
383	QUESTION	I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when you’re providing information that’s fake?	0
384	TRUMP	Well, I don’t know.	0
385	TRUMP	I was given that information.	0
386	TRUMP	I was given — actually, I’ve seen that information around.	0
387	TRUMP	But it was a very substantial victory.	0
388	TRUMP	Do you agree with that?	0
389	QUESTION	You’re the President.	0
390	TRUMP	Okay, thank you.	0
391	TRUMP	That’s a good answer.	0
392	TRUMP	Yes.	0
393	QUESTION	Mr. President, thank you so much.	0
394	QUESTION	Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn — there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed?	0
395	QUESTION	Did you have the transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly Ambassador Kislyak, who he was communicating with?	0
396	QUESTION	What evidence did you weigh to determine there was no wrong doing?	0
397	QUESTION	And further than that, sir, you’ve said on a couple of occasions this morning that you were going to aggressively pursue the sources of these leaks.	0
398	TRUMP	We are.	0
399	QUESTION	Can we ask what you’re doing to do?	0
400	QUESTION	And also, we’ve heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg.	0
401	QUESTION	What can you tell us about that?	0
402	TRUMP	Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they’re in position.	0
403	TRUMP	So I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.	0
404	TRUMP	The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man.	0
405	TRUMP	And he has offered his services, and it’s something we may take advantage of.	0
406	TRUMP	But I don’t think we’ll need that at all because of the fact that I think that we’re going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.	0
407	TRUMP	As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn’t sound wrong.	0
408	TRUMP	My counsel came — Don McGahn, White House Counsel — and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself.	0
409	TRUMP	He said he doesn’t think anything is wrong.	0
410	TRUMP	He really didn’t think — it was really what happened after that, but he didn’t think anything was done wrong.	0
411	TRUMP	I didn’t either, because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it.	0
412	TRUMP	I said, well, I don’t see — to me, he was doing the job.	0
413	TRUMP	The information was provided by — who I don’t know — Sally Yates — and I was a little surprised because I said, doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there.	0
414	TRUMP	But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable.	0
415	TRUMP	As far as the actual making the call — in fact, I’ve watched various programs and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job.	0
416	TRUMP	That was very normal.	0
417	TRUMP	At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong.	0
418	TRUMP	After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job.	0
419	TRUMP	So — and I do — and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man.	0
420	TRUMP	Yes, Jon.	0
421	QUESTION	On the leaks, sir —	0
422	TRUMP	Go ahead, finish off, then I’ll get you, Jon.	0
423	QUESTION	Sorry, what will you do on the leaks?	0
424	QUESTION	You have said twice today —	0
425	TRUMP	Yes, we’re looking at it very, very seriously.	0
426	TRUMP	I’ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we’re — I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks.	0
427	TRUMP	Those are criminal leaks.	0
428	TRUMP	They’re put out by people either in agencies.	0
429	TRUMP	I think you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in.	0
430	TRUMP	You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t get them approved by the Senate.	0
431	TRUMP	We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example.	0
432	TRUMP	So we are looking into that very seriously.	0
433	TRUMP	It’s a criminal act.	0
434	TRUMP	You know what I say — when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked.	0
435	TRUMP	Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment.	0
436	TRUMP	When I was called out on Mexico, I was — honestly, I was really, really surprised.	0
437	TRUMP	But I said, you know, it doesn’t make sense, that won’t happen.	0
438	TRUMP	But that wasn’t that important to call, it was fine.	0
439	TRUMP	I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world — the President who is a very fine man, by the way.	0
440	TRUMP	Same thing with Australia.	0
441	TRUMP	I said, that’s terrible that it was leaked but it wasn’t that important.	0
442	TRUMP	But then I said, what happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea?	0
443	TRUMP	What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East?	0
444	TRUMP	Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information — very important, very — I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?	0
445	TRUMP	So I don’t want classified information getting out to the public.	0
446	TRUMP	And in a way, that was almost a test.	0
447	TRUMP	So I’m dealing with Mexico.	0
448	TRUMP	I’m dealing with Argentina.	0
449	TRUMP	We were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn.	0
450	TRUMP	All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times.	0
451	TRUMP	And I’m saying, what’s going to happen when I’m dealing on the Middle East?	0
452	TRUMP	What’s going to happen when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?	0
453	TRUMP	We’ve got to stop it.	0
454	TRUMP	That’s why it’s a criminal penalty.	0
455	TRUMP	Yes, Jon.	0
456	QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
457	QUESTION	I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point.	0
458	QUESTION	Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign?	0
459	QUESTION	And, on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?	0
460	TRUMP	Well, the leaks are real.	0
461	TRUMP	You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them.	0
462	TRUMP	I mean, the leaks are real.	0
463	TRUMP	You know what they said — you saw it.	0
464	TRUMP	And the leaks are absolutely real.	0
465	TRUMP	The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.	0
466	TRUMP	So one thing that I felt it was very important to do — and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for — well, maybe a little bit — than reporters, than good reporters.	0
467	TRUMP	It’s very important to me, and especially in this position.	0
468	TRUMP	It’s very important.	0
469	TRUMP	I don’t mind bad stories.	0
470	TRUMP	I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it’s true.	0
471	TRUMP	And over a course of time, I’ll make mistakes and you’ll write badly and I’m okay with that.	0
472	TRUMP	But I’m not okay when it is fake.	0
473	TRUMP	I mean, I watch CNN — it’s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.	0
474	TRUMP	I don’t watch it anymore because it’s very good — he’s saying no.	0
475	TRUMP	It’s okay, Jim.	0
476	TRUMP	It’s okay, Jim.	0
477	TRUMP	You’ll have your chance.	0
478	TRUMP	But I watch others too.	0
479	TRUMP	You’re not the only one, so don’t feel badly.	0
480	TRUMP	But I think it should be straight.	0
481	TRUMP	I think it should be — I think it would be, frankly, more interesting.	0
482	TRUMP	I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now, but I think that actually would be — I think that it would actually be better.	0
483	TRUMP	People — I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress.	1
484	TRUMP	I think that’s right.	0
485	TRUMP	I don’t know, Peter, is that one right?	0
486	TRUMP	Because you know, I think they have lower — I heard, lower than Congress.	0
487	TRUMP	But honestly, the public would appreciate it.	0
488	TRUMP	I’d appreciate it.	0
489	TRUMP	Again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true.	0
490	TRUMP	But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.	0
491	TRUMP	I think we’re setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet.	0
492	TRUMP	I mean, the numbers are crazy.	0
493	TRUMP	When I’m looking — some of them had them approved immediately.	0
494	TRUMP	I’m going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for.	0
495	TRUMP	And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying.	0
496	TRUMP	And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there, and they have nothing going.	0
497	TRUMP	The only thing they can do is delay.	0
498	TRUMP	And you know, I think they’d be better served by approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody is good.	0
499	TRUMP	And sometimes, I mean — I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way.	0
500	TRUMP	And that’s okay.	0
501	TRUMP	That’s fine.	0
502	TRUMP	But I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly.	0
503	TRUMP	This is pure delay tactics.	0
504	TRUMP	And they say it, and everybody understands it.	0
505	TRUMP	Yeah, go ahead, Jim.	0
506	QUESTION	The first part of my question on contacts.	0
507	QUESTION	Do you definitively say that nobody —	0
508	TRUMP	Well, I had nothing to do with it.	0
509	TRUMP	I have nothing to do with Russia.	0
510	TRUMP	I told you, I have no deals there.	0
511	TRUMP	I have no anything.	0
512	TRUMP	Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give — they’re not giving classified information.	0
513	TRUMP	They’re giving stuff — what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates — which, by the way, nobody mentions.	1
514	TRUMP	Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.	1
515	TRUMP	Can you imagine — seriously, can you imagine if I received the questions?	0
516	TRUMP	It would be the electric chair, okay?	0
517	TRUMP	He should be put in the electric chair. You would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay?	0
518	TRUMP	Maybe not you, Jon.	0
519	TRUMP	Yes, we’ll do you next, Jim.	0
520	TRUMP	I’ll do you next.	0
521	TRUMP	Yes?	0
522	QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
523	QUESTION	I just want to clarify one other thing.	0
524	TRUMP	Sure.	0
525	QUESTION	Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss the sanctions with the Russian ambassador?	0
526	TRUMP	No, I didn’t.	0
527	TRUMP	No, I didn’t.	0
528	QUESTION	(Inaudible.)	0
529	QUESTION	(Off mic.)	0
530	TRUMP	No, I didn’t.	0
531	QUESTION	Did you fire him because (inaudible)	0
532	TRUMP	Excuse me — no, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence, very simple.	0
533	TRUMP	Mike was doing his job.	0
534	TRUMP	He was calling countries and his counterparts.	0
535	TRUMP	So it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it.	0
536	TRUMP	I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it.	0
537	TRUMP	I didn’t direct him but I would have directed him because that’s his job.	0
538	TRUMP	And it came out that way — and, in all fairness, I watched Dr.	0
539	TRUMP	Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job.	0
540	TRUMP	And I agreed with him.	0
541	TRUMP	And since then I’ve watched many other people say that.	0
542	TRUMP	No, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it, okay?	0
543	TRUMP	Jim.	0
544	QUESTION	Mr. President, thank you very much.	0
545	QUESTION	And just for the record, we don’t hate you, I don’t hate you.	0
546	QUESTION	If you could pass that along.	0
547	TRUMP	Okay.	0
548	TRUMP	Well, ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job, okay?	0
549	QUESTION	If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far, sir.	0
550	TRUMP	Well, not too many.	0
551	TRUMP	We do have other people.	0
552	TRUMP	You do have other people, and your ratings aren’t as good as some of the other people that are waiting.	0
553	QUESTION	They’re pretty good right now, actually.	0
554	TRUMP	Okay.	0
555	TRUMP	Go ahead, Jim.	0
556	QUESTION	If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle.	0
557	QUESTION	You welcomed that at one point.	0
558	TRUMP	I was okay with it.	0
559	QUESTION	You said you loved WikiLeaks.	0
560	QUESTION	At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 emails.	0
561	QUESTION	I’m wondering, sir, if you —	0
562	TRUMP	Well, she was actually missing 33,000, and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but that’s okay.	0
563	QUESTION	Maybe my numbers are off a little bit too.	0
564	TRUMP	No, no, but I did say 30,000, but it was actually higher than that.	0
565	QUESTION	If I may ask you, sir, it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaign.	0
566	TRUMP	Okay, fair question.	0
567	TRUMP	Ready?	0
568	QUESTION	So if I may ask you that — if I may ask a follow-up —	0
569	TRUMP	No, no, but are you — let me do one at a time.	0
570	TRUMP	Do you mind?	0
571	QUESTION	Yes, sir.	0
572	TRUMP	All right.	0
573	TRUMP	So in one case you’re talking about highly classified information.	0
574	TRUMP	In the other case you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss.	0
575	TRUMP	I will say this: If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.	0
576	TRUMP	He said terrible things about her.	0
577	TRUMP	But it wasn’t classified information.	0
578	TRUMP	But in one case you’re talking about classified.	0
579	TRUMP	Regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong — at my suggestion — and I give Reince great credit for this — at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.	0
580	TRUMP	I don’t want to be hacked.	0
581	TRUMP	And we did that, and you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed.	0
582	TRUMP	The DNC did not do that.	0
583	TRUMP	And if they did it, they could not have been hacked.	0
584	TRUMP	But they were hacked, and terrible things came.	0
585	TRUMP	And the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so — they were — when I heard some of those things, I said — I picked up the papers the next morning, I said, oh, this is going to front page.	0
586	TRUMP	It wasn’t even in the papers.	0
587	TRUMP	Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers.	0
588	TRUMP	I would have been the headline in every newspaper.	0
589	TRUMP	I mean, think of it.	0
590	TRUMP	They gave her the questions for the debate, and she should have reported herself.	0
591	TRUMP	Why didn’t Hillary Clinton announce that, "I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job"?	0
592	QUESTION	And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about — you said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake.	0
593	QUESTION	I guess I don’t understand.	0
594	QUESTION	It seems that there is a disconnect there.	0
595	QUESTION	If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?	0
596	TRUMP	Well, the reporting is fake.	0
597	TRUMP	Look, look —	0
598	QUESTION	And if I may ask — I just want to ask one other question.	0
599	TRUMP	Jim, you know what it is?	0
600	TRUMP	Here’s the thing.	0
601	TRUMP	The public isn’t — they read newspapers, they see television, they watch.	0
602	TRUMP	They don’t know if it’s true or false because they’re not involved.	0
603	TRUMP	I’m involved.	0
604	TRUMP	I’ve been involved with this stuff all my life.	0
605	TRUMP	But I’m involved.	0
606	TRUMP	So I know when you’re telling the truth or when you’re not.	0
607	TRUMP	I just see many, many untruthful things.	0
608	TRUMP	And I tell you what else I see.	0
609	TRUMP	I see tone.	0
610	TRUMP	You know the word "tone."	0
611	TRUMP	The tone is such hatred.	0
612	TRUMP	I’m really not a bad person, by the way.	0
613	TRUMP	No, but the tone is such — I do get good ratings, you have to admit that.	0
614	TRUMP	The tone is such hatred.	0
615	TRUMP	I watched this morning a couple of the networks, and I have to say "Fox & Friends" in the morning, they’re very honorable people.	0
616	TRUMP	They’re very — not because they’re good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong.	0
617	TRUMP	But they have the most honest morning show.	0
618	TRUMP	That’s all I can say.	0
619	TRUMP	It’s the most honest.	0
620	TRUMP	But the tone, Jim.	0
621	TRUMP	If you look — the hatred.	0
622	TRUMP	I mean, sometimes — sometimes somebody gets —	0
623	QUESTION	(Off mic.)	0
624	TRUMP	Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o’clock in the evening.	0
625	TRUMP	You just take a look at that show.	0
626	TRUMP	That is a constant hit.	0
627	TRUMP	The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump.	0
628	TRUMP	The good news is he doesn’t have good ratings.	0
629	TRUMP	But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump.	0
630	TRUMP	And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth, the hatred coming from other people on your network.	0
631	TRUMP	Now, I will say this.	0
632	TRUMP	I watch it.	0
633	TRUMP	I see it.	0
634	TRUMP	I’m amazed by it.	0
635	TRUMP	And I just think you’d be a lot better off — I honestly do.	0
636	TRUMP	The public gets it, you know.	0
637	TRUMP	Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN.	0
638	TRUMP	They want to throw their placards at CNN.	0
639	TRUMP	I think you would do much better by being different.	0
640	TRUMP	But you just take a look.	0
641	TRUMP	Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening.	0
642	TRUMP	If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it’s brutal.	0
643	TRUMP	Now, they’ll take this news conference.	0
644	TRUMP	I’m actually having a very good time, okay?	0
645	TRUMP	But they’ll take this news conference — don’t forget that’s the way I won.	0
646	TRUMP	Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day.	0
647	QUESTION	(Off mic.)	0
648	TRUMP	No, that’s how I won.	0
649	TRUMP	I won with news conferences and probably speeches.	0
650	TRUMP	I certainly didn’t win by people listening to you people, that’s for sure.	0
651	TRUMP	But I am having a good time.	0
652	TRUMP	Tomorrow they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.	0
653	TRUMP	I’m not ranting and raving.	0
654	TRUMP	I’m just telling you, you’re dishonest people.	0
655	TRUMP	But — but I’m not ranting and raving.	0
656	TRUMP	I love this.	0
657	TRUMP	I’m having a good time doing it.	0
658	TRUMP	But tomorrow the headlines are going to be: Donald Trump Rants and Raves.	0
659	TRUMP	I’m not ranting and raving.	0
660	QUESTION	If I may just —	0
661	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
662	QUESTION	One more follow-up because —	0
663	TRUMP	Should I let him have a little bit more?	0
664	TRUMP	What do you think, Peter?	0
665	QUESTION	Just because of this —	0
666	TRUMP	Peter, should I have let him have a little bit more?	0
667	TRUMP	Sit down.	0
668	TRUMP	Sit down.	0
669	QUESTION	Just because of the attack —	0
670	TRUMP	We’ll get it.	0
671	QUESTION	Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir —	0
672	TRUMP	I’m changing it from fake news, though.	0
673	QUESTION	Doesn’t that undermine —	0
674	TRUMP	Very fake news now.	0
675	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
676	QUESTION	But aren’t you —	0
677	TRUMP	Yes, go ahead.	0
678	QUESTION	Real news, Mr. President.	0
679	QUESTION	Real news.	0
680	TRUMP	And you’re not related to our new —	0
681	QUESTION	I am not related, sir, no.	0
682	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
683	TRUMP	I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.	0
684	TRUMP	I looked — you know, I looked at that name.	0
685	TRUMP	I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there?	0
686	TRUMP	Alex Acosta.	0
687	QUESTION	I’m sure you checked that out, sir.	0
688	TRUMP	No, I checked it.	0
689	TRUMP	I said — they said, no, sir.	0
690	TRUMP	I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.	0
691	QUESTION	But aren’t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people’s faith in the First Amendment freedom of the press, the press in this country when you call stories you don’t like "fake news"?	0
692	QUESTION	Why not just say it’s a story I don’t like?	0
693	TRUMP	I do that.	0
694	QUESTION	When you call it fake news, you’re undermining confidence —	0
695	TRUMP	No, I do that.	0
696	TRUMP	No, no, I do that.	0
697	QUESTION	— in our news media.	0
698	TRUMP	Here’s the thing.	0
699	QUESTION	Isn’t that important?	0
700	TRUMP	Okay, I understand — and you’re right about that except this.	0
701	TRUMP	See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad.	0
702	TRUMP	And sometimes I’ll say, wow, that’s going to be a great story, and I’ll get killed.	0
703	TRUMP	I know what’s good and bad.	0
704	TRUMP	I’d be a pretty good reporter — not as good as you.	0
705	TRUMP	But I know what’s good.	0
706	TRUMP	I know what’s bad.	0
707	TRUMP	And when they change it and make it really bad — something that should be positive.	0
708	TRUMP	Sometimes something that should be very positive, they’ll make okay.	0
709	TRUMP	They’ll even make it negative.	0
710	TRUMP	So I understand it because I’m there.	0
711	TRUMP	I know what was said.	0
712	TRUMP	I know who is saying it.	0
713	TRUMP	I’m there.	0
714	TRUMP	So it’s very important to me.	0
715	TRUMP	Look, I want to see an honest press.	0
716	TRUMP	When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press.	0
717	TRUMP	The press — the public doesn’t believe you people anymore.	0
718	TRUMP	Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I don’t know.	0
719	TRUMP	But they don’t believe you.	0
720	TRUMP	If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?	0
721	TRUMP	Of course, he had some questions also.	0
722	TRUMP	But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster, I would be your biggest fan in the world — including bad stories about me.	0
723	TRUMP	But if you go — as an example, you’re CNN — I mean, it’s story after story after story is bad.	0
724	TRUMP	I won.	0
725	TRUMP	I won.	0
726	TRUMP	And the other thing: Chaos.	0
727	TRUMP	There’s zero chaos.	0
728	TRUMP	We are running — this is a fine-tuned machine.	0
729	TRUMP	And Reince happens to be doing a good job.	0
730	TRUMP	But half of his job is putting out lies by the press.	0
731	TRUMP	I said to him yesterday, this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don’t talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks.	0
732	TRUMP	But I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper.	0
733	TRUMP	And I’m saying, here’s my Chief of Staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC.	0
734	TRUMP	I mean, we won the election, right?	0
735	TRUMP	We won the presidency.	0
736	TRUMP	We got some senators.	0
737	TRUMP	We got some — all over the country, you take a look, he’s done a great job.	0
738	TRUMP	And I said to myself, you know — and I said to somebody that was in the room — I said, you take a look at Reince, he’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires.	0
739	TRUMP	They’re fake.	0
740	TRUMP	They’re not true.	0
741	TRUMP	And isn’t that a shame, because he’d rather be working on health care.	0
742	TRUMP	He’d rather be working on tax reform, Jim.	0
743	TRUMP	I mean that.	0
744	TRUMP	I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right.	0
745	TRUMP	I sort of understand there’s a certain bias, maybe by Jeff or somebody — for whatever reason.	0
746	TRUMP	And I understand that.	0
747	TRUMP	But you’ve got to be at least a little bit fair.	0
748	TRUMP	And that’s why the public sees it — they see it.	0
749	TRUMP	They see it’s not fair.	0
750	TRUMP	You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.	0
751	TRUMP	And the public is smart.	0
752	TRUMP	They understand it.	0
753	TRUMP	Okay, yeah, go ahead.	0
754	QUESTION	We have no doubt that your latest story is (inaudible).	0
755	QUESTION	But for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn’t fake news?	0
756	QUESTION	And secondly —	0
757	TRUMP	I think they don’t believe it.	0
758	TRUMP	I don’t think the public would.	0
759	TRUMP	That’s why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof.	0
760	TRUMP	I don’t think they believe it.	0
761	TRUMP	Well, I guess one of the reasons I’m here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing — that’s a ruse.	0
762	TRUMP	That’s a ruse.	0
763	TRUMP	And, by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.	0
764	TRUMP	Now, tomorrow you’ll say, Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible.	0
765	TRUMP	It’s not terrible — it’s good.	0
766	TRUMP	We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset.	0
767	TRUMP	We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country.	1
768	TRUMP	You know what uranium is, right?	0
769	TRUMP	It’s this thing called nuclear weapons and other things.	0
770	TRUMP	Like, lots of things are done with uranium, including some bad things.	0
771	TRUMP	Nobody talks about that.	0
772	TRUMP	I didn’t do anything for Russia.	0
773	TRUMP	I’ve done nothing for Russia.	0
774	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium.	1
775	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks?	0
776	TRUMP	Here, take a look.	0
777	TRUMP	He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?	0
778	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton — that was a reset.	0
779	TRUMP	Remember?	0
780	TRUMP	It said "reset."	0
781	TRUMP	Now, if I do that, oh, I’m a bad guy.	0
782	TRUMP	If we could get along with Russia, that’s a positive thing.	0
783	TRUMP	We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly.	0
784	TRUMP	And I told him, I said, I know politically it’s probably not good for me.	0
785	TRUMP	Hey, the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that’s 30 miles offshore right out of the water.	0
786	TRUMP	Everyone in this country is going to say, oh, it’s so great.	0
787	TRUMP	That’s not great.	0
788	TRUMP	That’s not great.	0
789	TRUMP	I would love to be able to get along with Russia.	0
790	TRUMP	Now, you’ve had a lot of Presidents that haven’t taken that tact.	0
791	TRUMP	Look where we are now.	0
792	TRUMP	Look where we are now.	0
793	TRUMP	So, if I can — now, I love to negotiate things.	0
794	TRUMP	I do it really well and all that stuff, but it’s possible I won’t be able to get along with Putin.	0
795	TRUMP	Maybe it is.	0
796	TRUMP	But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people — the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia.	0
797	TRUMP	And probably Putin said, you know — he’s sitting behind his desk and he’s saying, you know, I see what’s going on in the United States, I follow it closely; it’s got to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he’s got with this fake story.	0
798	TRUMP	Okay?	0
799	TRUMP	And that’s a shame.	0
800	TRUMP	Because if we could get along with Russia — and, by the way, China and Japan and everyone — if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.	0
801	QUESTION	Mr. President, since you —	0
802	TRUMP	Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly.	0
803	TRUMP	We’re doing Obamacare — we’re in final stages.	0
804	TRUMP	We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say.	0
805	TRUMP	And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first.	0
806	TRUMP	It’s not like — frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner.	0
807	TRUMP	So we’ll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March.	0
808	TRUMP	And after that, we’re going to come up — and we’re doing very well on tax reform.	0
809	TRUMP	Yes.	0
810	QUESTION	Mr. President, you mentioned Russia.	0
811	QUESTION	Let’s talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as President of the United States.	0
812	TRUMP	Okay.	0
813	QUESTION	You mentioned the vessel, the spy vessel, off the coast of the United States.	0
814	TRUMP	Not good.	0
815	QUESTION	There was a ballistic missile test that many interpreted as a violation —	0
816	TRUMP	Not good.	0
817	QUESTION	— of the agreement between the two countries.	0
818	QUESTION	And a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.	0
819	TRUMP	Not good.	0
820	QUESTION	I listened to you during the campaign —	0
821	TRUMP	Excuse me, excuse me, when did it happen?	0
822	TRUMP	It happened when — if you were Putin right now, you would say, hey, we’re back to the old games with the United States.	0
823	TRUMP	There’s no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because the — you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, oh, isn’t that wonderful.	0
824	TRUMP	But I know you well enough.	0
825	TRUMP	Then you would say, oh, he was too tough, he shouldn’t have done that.	0
826	TRUMP	Look, of all —	0
827	QUESTION	I’m just trying to find out your orientation to those —	0
828	TRUMP	Wait a minute.	0
829	TRUMP	Wait, wait.	0
830	TRUMP	Excuse me just one second.	0
831	QUESTION	I’m just trying to find out what you’re doing to do about them, Mr. President.	0
832	TRUMP	All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he’s not going to be able to make a deal with me because it’s politically not popular for me to make a deal.	0
833	TRUMP	So Hillary Clinton tries to reset, it failed.	0
834	TRUMP	They all tried.	0
835	TRUMP	But I’m different than those people.	0
836	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
837	QUESTION	How are you interpreting those moves?	0
838	QUESTION	And what do you intend to do about them?	0
839	TRUMP	Just the way I said it.	0
840	QUESTION	Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?	0
841	TRUMP	I have.	0
842	TRUMP	I have.	0
843	TRUMP	And I’m so beautifully represented.	0
844	TRUMP	I’m so honored that the Senate approved him.	0
845	TRUMP	He’s going to be fantastic.	0
846	TRUMP	Yes, I think that I’ve already —	0
847	QUESTION	Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?	0
848	TRUMP	No, I don’t think so.	0
849	TRUMP	I think Putin probably assumes that he can’t make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal.	0
850	TRUMP	I can’t believe I’m saying I’m a politician, but I guess that’s what I am now.	0
851	TRUMP	Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we’re not going to make a deal.	0
852	TRUMP	Now, I don’t know that we’re going to make a deal.	0
853	TRUMP	I don’t know.	0
854	TRUMP	We might, we might not.	0
855	TRUMP	But it would be much easier for me to be so tough — the tougher I am on Russia, the better.	0
856	TRUMP	But you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people.	0
857	TRUMP	And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.	0
858	TRUMP	If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along — and don’t forget, we’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.	0
859	TRUMP	There’s no upside.	0
860	TRUMP	We’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.	0
861	TRUMP	I’ve been briefed.	0
862	TRUMP	And I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that we’re allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it: Nuclear holocaust would be like no other.	0
863	TRUMP	They’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are we.	0
864	TRUMP	If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing.	0
865	QUESTION	So when you say they’re not good, do you mean that they are —	0
866	TRUMP	Who did I say is not good?	0
867	QUESTION	No, when I read off the three things that have recently happened and each one of them you said they’re not good.	0
868	TRUMP	No, it’s not good, but they happened.	0
869	QUESTION	But do they damage the relationship?	0
870	QUESTION	Do they undermine this country’s ability to work with Russia?	0
871	TRUMP	They all happened recently, and I understand what they’re doing, because they’re doing the same thing.	0
872	TRUMP	Now, again, maybe I’m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried.	0
873	TRUMP	And if I don’t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump?	0
874	TRUMP	Does anybody in this room really believe that?	0
875	TRUMP	Okay.	0
876	TRUMP	But I tell you one thing: She tried to make a deal.	0
877	TRUMP	She had the reset.	0
878	TRUMP	She gave all the valuable uranium away.	0
879	TRUMP	She did other things.	0
880	TRUMP	You know, they say I’m close to Russia.	0
881	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States.	0
882	TRUMP	She’s close to Russia.	0
883	TRUMP	I gave — you know what I gave to Russia?	0
884	TRUMP	You know what I gave?	0
885	TRUMP	Nothing.	0
886	QUESTION	Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?	0
887	TRUMP	I’m not going to tell you anything about what response I do.	0
888	TRUMP	I don’t talk about military response.	0
889	TRUMP	I don’t say I’m going into Mosul in four months.	0
890	TRUMP	We are going to attack Mosul in four months. Then three months later: "We are going to attack Mosul in one month." "Next week, we are going to attack Mosul." In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult.	0
891	TRUMP	Do you know why?	0
892	TRUMP	Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things.	0
893	TRUMP	You’re going to be surprised to hear that.	0
894	TRUMP	And, by the way, my whole campaign, I’d say that.	0
895	TRUMP	So I don’t have to tell you —	0
896	QUESTION	There will be a response?	0
897	TRUMP	I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, "Yes, here’s what we’re going to do."	0
898	TRUMP	 I don’t have to do that.	0
899	QUESTION	There will be a — in other words, there will be a response, Mr. President?	0
900	TRUMP	I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.	0
901	TRUMP	Wait a minute.	0
902	TRUMP	I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.	0
903	TRUMP	And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran.	0
904	TRUMP	You know why?	0
905	TRUMP	Because they shouldn’t know.	0
906	TRUMP	And eventually you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.	0
907	TRUMP	So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship — the Russian ship, as an example — I’m not going to tell you.	0
908	TRUMP	But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything.	0
909	TRUMP	But I’m not going to tell you.	0
910	TRUMP	Okay.	0
911	QUESTION	Thanks.	0
912	QUESTION	Can I just ask you — thank you very much, Mr. President — the Trump —	0
913	TRUMP	Where are you from?	0
914	QUESTION	BBC.	0
915	TRUMP	Okay.	0
916	TRUMP	Here’s another beauty.	0
917	QUESTION	That’s a good line.	0
918	QUESTION	Impartial, free, and fair.	0
919	TRUMP	Yeah, sure.	0
920	QUESTION	Mr. President —	0
921	TRUMP	Just like CNN, right?	0
922	QUESTION	Mr. President, on the travel ban — we could banter back and forth.	0
923	QUESTION	On the travel ban, would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government, that fine-tuned —	0
924	TRUMP	Yeah, I do.	0
925	TRUMP	I do.	0
926	TRUMP	And let me tell you about the travel —	0
927	QUESTION	Were there any mistakes in that?	0
928	TRUMP	Wait, wait, wait.	0
929	TRUMP	I know who you are.	0
930	TRUMP	Just wait.	0
931	TRUMP	Let me tell you about the travel ban.	0
932	TRUMP	We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, but we had a bad court.	0
933	TRUMP	We got a bad decision.	0
934	TRUMP	We had a court that’s been overturned — again, maybe wrong, but I think it’s 80 percent of the time.	0
935	TRUMP	A lot.	0
936	TRUMP	We had a bad decision.	0
937	TRUMP	We’re going to keep going with that decision.	0
938	TRUMP	We’re going to put in a new executive order next week sometime.	0
939	TRUMP	But we had a bad decision.	0
940	TRUMP	That’s the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban.	0
941	TRUMP	You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports.	0
942	TRUMP	You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations.	0
943	TRUMP	Despite that, the only problem that we had is we had a bad court.	0
944	TRUMP	We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision.	0
945	TRUMP	Very bad for the safety and security of our country.	0
946	TRUMP	The rollout was perfect.	0
947	TRUMP	Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order but said one thing — and I said this to my people: Give them a one-month period of time.	0
948	TRUMP	But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month — the bad ones.	0
949	TRUMP	You do agree, there are bad people out there, right?	0
950	TRUMP	They’re not everybody that’s like you.	0
951	TRUMP	You have some bad people out there.	0
952	TRUMP	So Kelly said, you can’t do that.	0
953	TRUMP	And he was right.	0
954	TRUMP	As soon as he said it, I said, wow, never thought of it.	0
955	TRUMP	I said, how about one week?	0
956	TRUMP	He said, no good.	0
957	TRUMP	You got to do it immediately, because if you do it immediately, they don’t have time to come in.	0
958	TRUMP	Now, nobody ever reports that, but that’s why we did it quickly.	0
959	TRUMP	Now, if would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect.	0
960	TRUMP	The problems is we would have wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives, because a lot of bad people would have come into our country.	0
961	TRUMP	Now, in the meantime, we’ve vetting very, very strongly.	0
962	TRUMP	Very, very strongly.	0
963	TRUMP	But we need help, and we need help by getting that executive order passed.	0
964	QUESTION	Just a brief follow-up.	0
965	QUESTION	And if it’s so urgent, why not introduce —	0
966	TRUMP	Yes, go ahead.	0
967	QUESTION	Thank you.	0
968	QUESTION	I just was hoping that we could get a yes- or-no answer on one of these questions involving Russia.	0
969	QUESTION	Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?	0
970	TRUMP	Well, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing.	0
971	TRUMP	So that’s one person.	0
972	TRUMP	But he was dealing — as he should have been —	0
973	QUESTION	During the election?	0
974	TRUMP	No, no, nobody that I know of.	0
975	QUESTION	So you’re not aware of any contacts during the course of the election?	0
976	TRUMP	Look, look, how many times do I have to answer this question?	0
977	QUESTION	Can you just say yes or no on it?	0
978	TRUMP	Russia is a ruse.	0
979	TRUMP	Yeah, I know you have to get up and ask a question, so important.	0
980	TRUMP	Russia is a ruse.	0
981	TRUMP	I have nothing to do with Russia, haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years.	0
982	TRUMP	Don’t speak to people from Russia.	0
983	TRUMP	Not that I wouldn’t, I just have nobody to speak to.	0
984	TRUMP	I spoke to Putin twice.	0
985	TRUMP	He called me on the election — I told you this — and he called me on the inauguration, and a few days ago.	0
986	TRUMP	We had a very good talk, especially the second one — lasted for a pretty long period of time.	0
987	TRUMP	I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified, so I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it.	0
988	TRUMP	But we had a very, very good talk.	0
989	TRUMP	I have nothing to do with Russia.	0
990	TRUMP	To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.	0
991	TRUMP	Now, Manafort has totally denied it.	0
992	TRUMP	He denied it.	0
993	TRUMP	Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia.	0
994	TRUMP	I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that — whoever.	0
995	TRUMP	But people knew that.	0
996	TRUMP	Everybody knew that.	0
997	QUESTION	But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?	0
998	TRUMP	I have — you know what, he said no.	0
999	TRUMP	I can only tell you what he — now, he was replaced long before the election.	0
1000	TRUMP	You know that, right?	0
1001	TRUMP	He was replaced long before the election.	0
1002	TRUMP	When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election.	0
1003	TRUMP	But Paul Manafort, who’s a good man also, by the way — Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place.	0
1004	TRUMP	He was only there for a short period of time.	0
1005	TRUMP	How much longer should we stay here, folks?	0
1006	TRUMP	Five more minutes, is that okay?	0
1007	TRUMP	Five?	0
1008	QUESTION	Mr. President, on national security —	0
1009	TRUMP	Wait, let’s see, who’s — I want to find a friendly reporter.	0
1010	TRUMP	Are you a friendly reporter?	0
1011	TRUMP	Watch how friendly he is.	0
1012	TRUMP	Wait, wait — watch how friendly he is.	0
1013	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
1014	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
1015	QUESTION	So, first of all, my name is (inaudible) from (inaudible) Magazine.	0
1016	QUESTION	And (inaudible).	0
1017	QUESTION	I haven’t seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or any of the — anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic.	0
1018	QUESTION	We have an understanding of (inaudible).	0
1019	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
1020	QUESTION	However, what we are concerned about, and what we haven’t really heard be addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it.	0
1021	QUESTION	There have been reports out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks.	0
1022	QUESTION	There are people who are committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to —	0
1023	TRUMP	You see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question.	0
1024	TRUMP	And it’s not.	0
1025	TRUMP	It’s not.	0
1026	TRUMP	Not a simple question, not a fair question.	0
1027	TRUMP	Okay, sit down.	0
1028	TRUMP	I understand the rest of your question.	0
1029	TRUMP	So here’s the story, folks.	0
1030	TRUMP	Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life.	0
1031	TRUMP	Number two, racism — the least racist person.	0
1032	TRUMP	In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican.	0
1033	QUESTION	(Inaudible.)	0
1034	TRUMP	Quiet, quiet, quiet.	0
1035	TRUMP	See, he lied about — he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question.	0
1036	TRUMP	So you know, welcome to the world of the media.	0
1037	TRUMP	But let me just tell you something — that I hate the charge.	0
1038	TRUMP	I find it repulsive.	0
1039	TRUMP	I hate even the question because people that know me — and you heard the Prime Minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday — did you hear him, Bibi?	0
1040	TRUMP	He said, I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time, and then he said, forget it.	0
1041	TRUMP	So you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.	0
1042	TRUMP	Yeah, go ahead.	0
1043	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
1044	QUESTION	Thank you.	0
1045	QUESTION	I’m Lisa from the PBS —	0
1046	TRUMP	See, it just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is.	0
1047	QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
1048	QUESTION	Lisa Desjardins from the PBS Newshour.	0
1049	TRUMP	Good.	0
1050	QUESTION	On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you planned for next week, even its broad outlines?	0
1051	QUESTION	Will it be focused on specific countries?	0
1052	TRUMP	It’s a very fair question.	0
1053	QUESTION	And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration, what is your plan?	0
1054	QUESTION	Do you plan to continue that program or to end it?	0
1055	TRUMP	We’re going to show great heart.	0
1056	TRUMP	DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you.	0
1057	TRUMP	To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have, because you have these incredible kids, in many cases — not in all cases.	0
1058	TRUMP	In some of the cases they’re having DACA and they’re gang members and they’re drug dealers too.	0
1059	TRUMP	But you have some absolutely incredible kids — I would say mostly — they were brought here in such a way — it’s a very, very tough subject.	0
1060	TRUMP	We are going to deal with DACA with heart.	0
1061	TRUMP	I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don’t forget, and I have to convince them that what I’m saying is right.	0
1062	TRUMP	And I appreciate your understanding on that.	0
1063	TRUMP	But the DACA situation is a very, very — it’s a very difficult thing for me.	0
1064	TRUMP	Because, you know, I love these kids.	0
1065	TRUMP	I love kids.	0
1066	TRUMP	I have kids and grandkids.	0
1067	TRUMP	And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do.	0
1068	TRUMP	And you know, the law is rough.	0
1069	TRUMP	I’m not talking about new laws.	0
1070	TRUMP	I’m talking the existing law is very rough.	0
1071	TRUMP	It’s very, very rough.	0
1072	TRUMP	As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision, but we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways more.	0
1073	TRUMP	But we’re tailoring it now to the decision.	0
1074	TRUMP	We have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.	0
1075	TRUMP	And the new executive order is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court.	0
1076	TRUMP	Okay?	0
1077	QUESTION	Mr. President, Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office.	0
1078	QUESTION	President, Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office.	0
1079	TRUMP	Yes.	0
1080	QUESTION	And she does a lot of great work for the country as well.	0
1081	QUESTION	Can you tell us a little bit about what First Lady Melania Trump does for the country?	0
1082	QUESTION	And there is a unique level of interest in your administration, so by opening the White House Visitors Office, what does that mean to you?	0
1083	TRUMP	Now, that’s what I call a nice question.	0
1084	TRUMP	That is very nice.	0
1085	TRUMP	Who are you with?	0
1086	QUESTION	(Inaudible.)	0
1087	TRUMP	Good.	0
1088	TRUMP	I’m going to start watching.	0
1089	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
1090	TRUMP	Melania is terrific.	0
1091	TRUMP	She was here last night.	0
1092	TRUMP	We had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife, who is, by the way, lovely.	0
1093	TRUMP	And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba.	0
1094	TRUMP	And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election as you know, the Cuban people, Americans.	0
1095	TRUMP	And I think that Melania is going to be outstanding.	0
1096	TRUMP	That’s right, she just opened up the Visitors Center — in other words, touring of the White House.	0
1097	TRUMP	She, like others that she’s working with, feels very, very strongly about women’s issues, women’s difficulties, very, very strongly.	0
1098	TRUMP	And she’s a very, very strong advocate.	0
1099	TRUMP	I think she’s a great representative for this country.	0
1100	TRUMP	And a funny thing happens because she gets so unfairly maligned.	0
1101	TRUMP	The things they say — I’ve known her for a long time.	0
1102	TRUMP	She was a very successful person.	0
1103	TRUMP	She was a very successful model.	0
1104	TRUMP	She did really well.	0
1105	TRUMP	She would go home at night and didn’t even want to go out with people.	0
1106	TRUMP	She was a very private person.	0
1107	TRUMP	She was always the highest quality that you’ll ever find.	0
1108	TRUMP	And the things they say — and I’ve known her for a long time — the things they say are so unfair.	0
1109	TRUMP	And actually, she’s been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.	0
1110	TRUMP	I’d just tell you this: I think she’s going to be a fantastic First Lady.	0
1111	TRUMP	She’s going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people.	0
1112	TRUMP	And helping her and working with her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman.	0
1113	TRUMP	And they’re not doing this for money.	0
1114	TRUMP	They’re not doing this for pay.	0
1115	TRUMP	They’re doing this because they feel it, both of them.	0
1116	TRUMP	And Melania goes back and forth, and after Barron finishes school — because it’s hard to take a child out of school with a few months left — she and Barron will be moving over to the White House.	0
1117	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
1118	TRUMP	That’s a very nice question.	0
1119	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
1120	QUESTION	Mr. President.	0
1121	TRUMP	Yes.	0
1122	TRUMP	Oh, this is going to be a bad question but that’s okay.	0
1123	QUESTION	No, it’s not going to be a bad question.	0
1124	TRUMP	Good, because I enjoy watching you on television.	0
1125	QUESTION	Well, thank you so much.	0
1126	QUESTION	Mr. President, I need to find out from you — you said something as it relates to inner cities.	0
1127	QUESTION	That was one of your platforms during your campaign.	0
1128	TRUMP	Fix the inner cities, yes.	0
1129	QUESTION	Fixing the inner cities.	0
1130	QUESTION	What will be that fix and your urban agenda, as well as your HBCU executive order that’s coming out this afternoon?	0
1131	QUESTION	See, it wasn’t bad, was it?	0
1132	TRUMP	That was very professional and very good.	0
1133	QUESTION	I’m very professional.	0
1134	TRUMP	We’ll be announcing the order in a little while, and I’d rather let the order speak for itself.	0
1135	TRUMP	But it will be something I think that will be very good for everybody concerned.	0
1136	TRUMP	But we’ll talk to you about that after we do the announcement.	0
1137	TRUMP	As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.	0
1138	TRUMP	I think it’s probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get.	0
1139	TRUMP	We did much higher than people thought I was going to get and I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.	0
1140	TRUMP	And, by the way, if I might add, including the women’s vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get.	0
1141	TRUMP	So we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities having to do with education, having to do with crime.	0
1142	TRUMP	We’re going to try and fix as quickly as possible — you know it takes a long time.	0
1143	TRUMP	It’s taken 100 years or more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved many of them very badly.	0
1144	TRUMP	But we’re going to be working very hard on health and health care; very, very hard on education.	0
1145	TRUMP	And also, we’re going to working in a stringent way, and a very good way, on crime.	0
1146	TRUMP	You go to some of these inner city places, and it’s so sad when you look at the crime.	0
1147	TRUMP	You have people — and I’ve seen this, and I’ve sort of witnessed it.	0
1148	TRUMP	In fact, in two cases, I have actually witnessed it.	0
1149	TRUMP	They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.	0
1150	TRUMP	They’re living in hell.	0
1151	TRUMP	We can’t let that happen.	0
1152	TRUMP	So we’re going to be very, very strong.	0
1153	TRUMP	It’s a great question, and it’s a very difficult situation, because it’s been many, many years.	0
1154	TRUMP	It’s been festering for many, many years.	0
1155	TRUMP	But we have places in this country that we have to fix.	0
1156	TRUMP	We have to help African American people that, for the most part are stuck there — Hispanic American people.	0
1157	TRUMP	We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities, and they’re living in hell.	0
1158	TRUMP	I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago.	0
1159	TRUMP	There are two Chicagos, as you know.	0
1160	TRUMP	There’s one Chicago that’s incredible, luxurious and all, and safe.	0
1161	TRUMP	There’s another Chicago that’s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about, and that you talk about every night on the newscasts.	0
1162	TRUMP	So we’re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.	0
1163	TRUMP	I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities.	0
1164	QUESTION	Well, when you say — when you say the inner cities, are you going to include the CBC, Mr.	0
1165	QUESTION	President, in your conversations with your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as your —	0
1166	TRUMP	Am I going include who?	0
1167	QUESTION	Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as well as —	0
1168	TRUMP	Well, I would.	0
1169	TRUMP	I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?	0
1170	TRUMP	Do you want to set up the meeting?	0
1171	QUESTION	No, no, no.	0
1172	TRUMP	Are they friends of yours?	0
1173	QUESTION	I’m just a reporter.	0
1174	TRUMP	No, go ahead, set up the meeting.	0
1175	QUESTION	I know some of them, but I’m sure they’re watching right now.	0
1176	TRUMP	Let’s go set up a meeting.	0
1177	TRUMP	I would love to meet with the Black Caucus.	0
1178	TRUMP	I think it’s great — the Congressional Black Caucus.	0
1179	TRUMP	I think it’s great.	0
1180	TRUMP	I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I can’t move, it might be bad for me politically, I can’t have that meeting.	0
1181	TRUMP	I was all set to have the meeting.	0
1182	TRUMP	You know, we called him and called him, and he was all set.	0
1183	TRUMP	I spoke to him on the phone.	0
1184	TRUMP	Very nice guy.	0
1185	QUESTION	I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.	0
1186	TRUMP	He wanted it.	0
1187	TRUMP	But we called, called, called, called — they can’t make a meeting with him.	0
1188	TRUMP	Every day, I walked in, I said, I would like to meet with him.	0
1189	TRUMP	Because I do want to solve the problem.	0
1190	TRUMP	But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that — some other lightweight — he was probably told — he was probably told, don’t meet with Trump, it’s bad politics.	0
1191	TRUMP	And that’s part of the problem of this country.	0
1192	TRUMP	Okay, one more.	0
1193	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
1194	QUESTION	Yes, Mr. President, two questions —	0
1195	TRUMP	No, no.	0
1196	TRUMP	One question.	0
1197	TRUMP	Two, we can’t handle.	0
1198	TRUMP	This room can’t handle two.	0
1199	TRUMP	Go ahead, give me the better of your two.	0
1200	QUESTION	(Inaudible)	0
1201	QUESTION	it’s not about your personality or your beliefs.	0
1202	QUESTION	We’re talking about (inaudible)	0
1203	QUESTION	around the country, some of it by supporters in your name.	0
1204	QUESTION	What do you —	0
1205	TRUMP	And some of it — and can I be honest with you?	0
1206	TRUMP	And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up.	0
1207	TRUMP	Some of it written by our opponents.	0
1208	TRUMP	You do know that.	0
1209	TRUMP	Do you understand that?	0
1210	TRUMP	You don’t think anybody would do a thing like that.	0
1211	TRUMP	Some of the signs you’ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they’re put up by the other side, and you think it’s like playing it straight.	0
1212	TRUMP	No.	0
1213	TRUMP	But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side.	0
1214	TRUMP	They’ll do signs and they’ll do drawings that are inappropriate.	0
1215	TRUMP	It won’t be my people.	0
1216	TRUMP	It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you.	0
1217	TRUMP	Okay.	0
1218	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
1219	QUESTION	You are the President now.	0
1220	QUESTION	What are you going to do about it?	0
1221	TRUMP	Where is that?	0
1222	TRUMP	Oh, stand up.	0
1223	TRUMP	You can —	0
1224	QUESTION	What are you going to do about the tensions that have been discussed?	0
1225	TRUMP	Oh, I’m working on it.	0
1226	TRUMP	No, I’m working on it very hard.	0
1227	QUESTION	Are you going to give a speech?	0
1228	TRUMP	No, no, look.	0
1229	TRUMP	Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years, and long before that, in all fairness to President Obama.	0
1230	TRUMP	Long before President Obama, we have had a very divided.	0
1231	TRUMP	I didn’t come along and divide this country.	0
1232	TRUMP	This country was seriously divided before I got here.	0
1233	TRUMP	We’re going to work on it very hard.	0
1234	TRUMP	One of the questions that was asked — I thought it was a very good question — was about the inner cities.	0
